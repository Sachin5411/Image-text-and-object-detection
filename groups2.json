It Is As Varied As The Land Itself And Helps In Binding People Of The Country Together. Indian Dance Forms Depict Ancient Civilization.<br><br>Dance In India Has An Unbroken Tradition Of Over 2000 Years. Its Themes Are Derived From Mythology, Legends And Classical Literature. There Are Two Main Forms Of Dances In India They Are The Folk Dance And Classical Dance. <br><br>Most Of The Classical Dances Were First Conceived And Nurtured In The Temples. They Attained Their Full Stature There. Classical Dance Forms Are Based On The Ancient Dance Discipline. They Have Rigid Rules Of Presentation.<br><br>Indian Classical Dances Follow The Principles And Rules Laid Down By Bharat Muni In His Natyashastra Many Ages Ago. Music, Dance And Drama Have Been An Integral Part Of Indian Religious And Secular Life.<br><br>Five Indian Classical Dances Are Famous All Over The World. These Are Bharat Natyam, Kathakali, Manipuri, Kathak And Moiniattam Of Kerala. The Concept Of Rasa Holds The Central Place In Dance. While Dancing Rasa Is Conveyed Through Bhava And Abhinaya.<br><br>Bharat Natyam Originated From Tamil Nadu But Has Spread Its Presence Throughout The Country. It Is Associated With Lord Shiva. Kathakali Is A Dance Form Of Kerala And Its Themes Revolve Around The Ramayana, The Mahabharata, The Puranas Or The Vedas. Manipuri Is A Delicate Lyrical Style Of Dance Of Manipur. It Is Based On The Romance Of The Divine Krishna And Radha. Kathak Is A Major Classical Dance Form Of North India. It Portrays The Mughal Influence On Indian Culture. Orissa Once Practiced As A Temple Dance Has Its Origin From Orissa. Earlier Only Dedanses Could Perform This Dance In Front Of Lord Jagannath But Today It Has Developed Into An All Indian Form.<br><br>Folk Dance Portrays The Tradition Of The Common People Belonging To A Region. Indian Folk Dances Enjoy Relatively Greater Freedom Of Expressing Their Feelings, Emotions And Sentiments Than Classical Dances. The Theme Is Generally Connected With The Performer's Life, Daily Activities And The Environment. It May Also Be Derived From Nature In Its Various Moods And Seasons. Folk Dances Imbibe New Influence And At The Same Maintain Tradition And Continuity<br><br>The Classical Dances Of India Are Usually Spiritual In Content Whereas Celebration Is The Main Motive Behind The Folk Dances Of India. Dances Are A Form Of Coherent Expression Of Human Feelings And Are Not Restricted To A Particular Community But, On The Whole An Asset To India Cultural Heritage.<br><br>Some Western Dance Forms Are Also Found In India Which Attracts The Younger Generation. For Teenagers Dance Is Only A Bodily Expression Of Joy And Happiness. Weston Dance Forms Are Very Popular In Many Late Night Clubs, Dance Bars And Pubs Which Have Been Opened In Cities. However Such Dance Forms Cannot Claim To Be A Part Of Indian Art Or Culture.<br><br>Dance Is A Highly Developed Art Which Needs Immense Discipline And Years Of Training. Many People Have Adopted Various Forms Of Dance As Their Profession And Have Earned Great Fame In Their Chosen Field.

With Every One, We've Got To Make A Decision. Yes, No, Maybe, Kinda, Later, Now, Bigger, Smaller, Hotter, Colder, Cuter, Higher Paying, Less Traveling? Taxi, Subway, Bus, Walk, Or Ride?

A Handful Of These Choices, May Actually Be More Life-and-death, Or At Least Happy Life And Slow Meaningless Decline Into Death. Little Things Like Who Gets Our Attention, When Do They Get It, And Why? What Gets The Nod, What Gets Turned Down, And How Much Will Someone Need To Give Us - In Money, Love, Attention, Or A Sense Of Purpose - To Make It Worth A Yes! What Projects, Jobs, Activities, And Relationships Do We Welcome, And What Do We Say No To?

		"description" : "<b>There’s A Big Myth In Our Culture: That Passion Can Only Be Spontaneous. You Either Love Your Job Or You Don’t. You Either Enjoy Exercising Or Hate It. You Are Interested In Reading Books Or You Find Them Boring. That Passion Can’t Be Forced Or Created.I Disagree. Passion Can Be Created. Even For Things You Don’t Currently Enjoy.By Tweaking The Activities And Pursuits You Engage In, You Can Find A Passion For Anything. All It Takes Is A Bit Of Patience And An Open Mind.The Benefit Is That You End Up Loving The Things You Have To Do Anyways. Exercising, Learning, Studying, Working And Almost Any Pursuit Can Be Made Into A Passion. And If You Know How To Do It, Existing Passions Can Be Turned From Mildly Interesting To Exciting. The Skill Of Finding Your Passion Is Like Turning Up The Dial For The Amount Of Color You Experience In Life.Here Are Some Ways To Find Your Passion:</b><div><b><br></b><div><b>1. Get Curious&nbsp;–</b> Curiosity Is The Basis Of Passion. Shake Off Your Current Understandings And Begin From The View That You Are Almost Completely Ignorant On The Subject. Then Look For Novelty To Boost Your Interest.</div><div><b>2. Make It A Game</b> –&nbsp;Give Yourself Rules, Objectives And Strategic Constraints. The More Creative Thinking Required, The Better.</div><div><b>3. Set A Goal&nbsp;</b>– Create A Specific Goal Along With A Deadline. This Can Infuse Mundane Activities With A Sense Of Direction And Purpose. Writing A Report Goes From Being Just Another Task, To A Creative Challenge That Pushes You.</div><div>4. Express Yourself&nbsp;– Find Hidden Opportunities For Self-expression. This Could Mean Inventing A Style For Folding Clothes. Changing The Format You Write Code In Or Altering The Style Of Your Presentation. View Each Activity As An Act Of Expression And Originality.</div><div><b>5. Focus&nbsp;– </b>Cut Distractions And Eliminate Noise. The More You Focus On An Activity The Better You Can Notice Interesting Qualities About It. The Only Truly Boring Activity Is The One You Can’t Pay Attention To.</div><div><b>6. Jigsaw Piecing&nbsp;</b>– A Jigsaw Puzzle Has Hundreds Of Uniquely Shaped Pieces Of A Picture. View Your Activities As Pieces Of A Larger Image. This Can Turn Dull Activities Into Individual Snippets Of A More Fascinating Whole.</div><div><b>7. Dial Down Cravings </b>–&nbsp;Have You Ever Noticed How The Hungrier You Are, The Less Able You Are To Enjoy The Taste Of Food? This Works The Same Way With Passion. The More You Crave A Goal (instead Of The Process Containing The Goal) The Less Likely You Are To Develop A Passion For It. Goal-setting Is Good. Goal-obsession Is Not.</div><div><b>8. Connect With Talents</b>&nbsp;– How Can You Apply Your Existing Talents To An Activity? Find Ways To Use Skills You Already Have In A New Endeavor. An Artistic Person Could Draw Pictures To Help Himself Study. An Athletic Person Might Be Able To Use Her Strength And Endurance As A Speaker.</div><div><b>9. Overcome The Frustration Barrier&nbsp;–</b> If An Activity Is Too Difficult For You To Become Enthusiastic About It, Slow Down. Worry Less About Results And More About Experimenting Until You Build Up Skill. Whenever I Try A New Hobby, I Strive To Just Try Things Out Before Building Skills. This Keeps Me From Getting Frustrated And Ensures The Process Is Fun.</div><div><b>10. Leech Enthusiasm&nbsp;–</b> Energy Is Contagious. If You Spend Time With Someone Who Exudes Passion About A Subject, Some Of It Will Rub Off On You. Seek Out People Who Have The Energy You Want And Get Them To Describe Their Motivation. Often It Will Point You To Key Information You Had No Idea Could Be So Interesting.</div><div><b>11. Remove The Chains&nbsp;–</b> Feeling Forced Into An Activity Is A Sure Way To Kill Any Passion. Instead Of Flowing With The Task, You Rebel Against It, Making You Miserable. Be Aware Of The Consequences For Not Acting, But Remove The Feeling That You Don’t Have A Choice. You Always Have A Choice.</div><div><b>12. Tune The Challenge&nbsp;–</b> For Boring Tasks, Make Them More Difficult. For Frustrating Tasks, Make Them Easier. This Can Be Done By Varying The Speed Or Constraints You Need To Complete A Task. Boring Chores Can Be Made More Interesting By Setting A Time-limit. Frustrating Assignments Can Be Made Easier By Allowing Yourself An Awful First-draft Instead Of Perfection.</div><div><b>13. Get Instruction&nbsp;– </b>Finding A Teacher Can Give You The Basic Level Of Understanding Necessary To Enjoy An Activity. Sometimes Passion Can Be Drained Just By Not Knowing The Basics.</div><div><b>14. Humble Confidence&nbsp;–</b> Confidence Is Necessary For Passion, But Arrogance Can Destroy It. Build A Humble Confidence Where You Believe In Your Abilities To Handle The Unknown, But You Also Have A Great Respect For It.</div><div><b>15. Focus Immediately&nbsp;–</b> Look At The Next Immediate Step. Don’t Concern Yourself Over What Needs To Be Done Next Month Or Next Year If It Overwhelms You. Focus On Each Step Of The Marathon, Not How Many Miles You Have Left.</div><div><b>16. Play&nbsp;–</b> If The Process Confuses Or Bothers You, Just Play With It. Don’t Have A Purpose Until You Can Define One.</div><div><b>17. Eliminate&nbsp;</b>– This One Might Not Apply, But It Is Always Good To Use. If You Really Can’t Enjoy Something, Find A Way To Eliminate It From Your Life. Don’t Waste Your Time Doing Things You Don’t Enjoy. Either Cultivate A Passion Or Get Rid Of It.</div></div>"

		"title" : "A Happy Life May Not Be a Meaningful Life",
		"description" : "<b>Tasks That Seem Mundane, Or Even Difficult, Can Bring A Sense&nbsp;of Meaning Over Time.</b><b></b>Psychiatrist And Holocaust Survivor <b>Viktor Frank</b>l Once Wrote, “Life Is Never Made Unbearable By Circumstances, But Only By Lack Of Meaning And Purpose.” For Most People, Feeling Happy And Finding Life Meaningful Are Both Important And Related Goals. But Do Happiness And Meaning Always Go Together? It Seems Unlikely, Given That Many Of The Things That We Regularly Choose To Do – From Running Marathons To Raising Children – Are Unlikely To Increase Our Day-to-day Happiness. Recent Research Suggests That While Happiness And A Sense Of Meaning Often Overlap, They Also Diverge In Important And Surprising Ways.Roy Baumeister And His Colleagues Recently Published A&nbsp;study&nbsp;in TheJournal Of Positive Psychology&nbsp;that Helps Explain Some Of The Key Differences Between A Happy Life And A Meaningful One. They Asked Almost 400 American Adults To Fill Out Three Surveys Over A Period Of Weeks. The Surveys Asked People To Answer A Series Of Questions Their Happiness Levels, The Degree To Which They Saw Their Lives As Meaningful, And Their General Lifestyle And Circumstances.As One Might Expect, People’s Happiness Levels Were Positively Correlated With Whether They Saw Their Lives As Meaningful. However, The Two Measures Were Not Identical – Suggesting That What Makes Us Happy May Not Always Bring More Meaning, And Vice Versa. To Probe For Differences Between The Two, The Researchers Examined The Survey Items That Asked Detailed Questions About People’s Feelings And Moods, Their Relationships With Others, And Their Day-to-day Activities. Feeling Happy Was Strongly Correlated With Seeing Life As Easy, Pleasant, And Free From Difficult Or Troubling Events. Happiness Was Also Correlated With Being In Good Health And Generally Feeling Well Most Of The Time. However, None Of These Things Were Correlated With A Greater Sense Of Meaning. Feeling Good Most Of The Time Might Help Us Feel Happier, But It Doesn’t Necessarily Bring A Sense Of Purpose To Our Lives.Interestingly, Their Findings Suggest That Money, Contrary To Popular Sayings, Can Indeed Buy Happiness. Having Enough Money To Buy What One Needs In Life, As Well As What One Desires, Were Also Positively Correlated With Greater Levels Of Happiness. However, Having Enough Money Seemed To Make Little Difference In Life’s Sense Of Meaning. This Same Disconnect Was Recently Found In A Multi-national&nbsp;study&nbsp;conducted By Shigehiro Oishi And Ed Diener, Who Show That People From Wealthy Countries Tend To Be Happier, However, They Don’t See Their Lives As More Meaningful. In Fact, Oishi And Diener Found That People From Poorer Countries Tend To See Their Lives As More Meaningful. Although The Reasons Are Not Totally Clear, This Might Be Related To Greater Religious Belief, Having More Children, And Stronger Social Ties Among Those Living In Poorer Countries. Perhaps Instead Of Saying That “money Doesn’t Buy Happiness,” We Ought To Say Instead That “money Doesn’t Buy Meaning”.Not Too Surprisingly, Our Relationships With Other People Are Related To Both How Happy We Are As Well As How Meaningful We See Our Lives. In Baumeister’s Study, Feeling More Connected To Others Improved Both Happiness And Meaning. However, The Role We Adopt In Our Relationships Makes An Important Difference. Participants In The Study Who Were More Likely To Agree With The Statement, “I Am A Giver,” Reported Less Happiness Than People Who Were More Likely To Agree With, “I Am A Taker.” However, The “givers” Reported Higher Levels Of Meaning In Their Lives Compared To The “takers.” In Addition, Spending More Time With Friends Was Related To Greater Happiness But Not More Meaning. In Contrast, Spending More Time With People One Loves Was Correlated With Greater Meaning But Not With More Happiness. The Researchers Suspect That Spending Time With Loved Ones Is Often More Difficult, But Ultimately More Satisfying, Than Spending Time With Friends.When It Comes To Thinking About How To Be Happier, Many Of Us Fantasize About Taking More Vacations Or Finding Ways To Avoid Mundane Tasks. We May Dream About Skipping Housework And Instead Doing Something Fun And Pleasurable. However, Tasks Which Don’t Make Us Happy Can, Over Time, Add Up To A Meaningful Life. Even Routine Activities — Talking On The Phone, Cooking, Cleaning, Housework, Meditating, Emailing, Praying, Waiting On Others, And Balancing Finances — Appeared To Bring More Meaning To People’s Lives, But Not Happiness In The Moment.More Broadly, The Findings Suggest That Pure Happiness Is About Getting What We Want In Life—whether Through People, Money, Or Life Circumstances. Meaningfulness, In Contrast, Seems To Have More To Do With Giving, Effort, And Sacrifice. It Is Clear That A Highly Meaningful Life May Not Always Include A Great Deal Of Day-to-day Happiness. And, The Study Suggests, Our American Obsession With Happiness May Be Intimately Related To A Feeling Of Emptiness, Or A Life That Lacks Meaning.Are You A Scientist Who Specializes In Neuroscience, Cognitive"

		"description" : "With The Competition Keener Than Ever And The Economy In A Slump, You Need To Prepare For Your Job Interview Thoroughly. It’s No Longer Enough To Offer A Firm Handshake To Your Interviewer, Make Eye Contact, And Nod Pleasantly Now And Then. You Need To Prepare A Dynamic Application Letter And Resume. You Need To Research The Company. And You Need To Present A Confident Image And Develop The Ability To Answer Tough Questions On The Spot.<div><br></div><div>Although No One Can Predict The Questions Your Potential Employer Will Ask, You Can Think About How You’d Answer Some Of The Commonly Asked Ones. Here Are Ten Questions For You To Consider And A Few Hints About How To Answer Them:</div><div><br></div><div><b>Tell Me About Yourself</b>.</div><div>Chances Are The Employer Doesn’t Want To Know How Much You Weighed When You Were Born, When You Learned To Tie Your Shoes, Or How Much You Had To Drink Last Night. He Or She Wants To Know How You Would Fit Into The Company And What Your Relevant Job Experience Is. You Might Answer By Asking The Interviewer What He’d Like To Know. Or You Might Talk About Your Education, The Fact That You’re A Team Player, Or Whatever You Think Might Be Important To This Particular Company.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Why Should We Hire You?</b></div><div>Even Though Five People May Be Waiting Outside, You Need To Sound Confident, Calm, And Capable. Explain How Your Experience Has Prepared You For The Job. Emphasize The Qualities You Think The Employer Is Looking For, Such As Your Outstanding Work Ethic Or The Fact That You’re A Fast Learner.</div><div><br></div><div><b>What Is Your Worst Characteristic?</b></div><div>Some Human Resource Specialists Suggest That You Make A Virtue Sound Like A Flaw. “I Tend To Be A Perfectionist,” Or, “Everyone Says I Work Too Hard.” But Others Say These Answers Have Become Clichés. Mention A Minor Flaw, Such As, “I Think I’m Too Outspoken At Times, But I’m Working On It.”</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><b>Where Do You Want To Be Five Years From Now?</b></div><div>Let The Interviewer Know You’re Looking For Job Stability And That You Aren’t Planning To Use This Job As A Temporary Stopping Point In Your Quest For A Better Position. You Could Say, “I’d Like To Be Employed In A Small Company Like This One, Where I Can Learn,contribute, And Advance.”&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Why Did You Leave Your Last Job?</b></div><div>Never Put Your Former Employer Or Your Co-workers In A Negative Light. Don’t Blame Them For Your Departure. Give A Positive Reason, Such As You Left To Take Advantage Of Another Opportunity That Was Better Suited To Your Skills.&nbsp;</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Tell Me About A Problem You Had In Your Life And How You Solved It.</b></div><div>Be Prepared With A Short Answer That Shows You’re Resourceful. “I Really Wanted To Go To A Private University, But My Parents Didn’t Have The Money. I Went To A Community College For Two Years, Worked Part Time And Saved My Money So I Could Attend The Last Two Years At The College Of My Choice.”&nbsp;</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Have You Had Difficulties Getting Along With Supervisors Or Co-workers?</b></div><div>You’d Have To Be A Saint To Have Had No Problems With The People You Worked With. You Might Answer, “Nothing Major. I Try To Get Along With Everyone.”&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>How Do You Deal With Stress On The Job?</b></div><div>The Employer Wants To Know If You’re Going To Run Out The Door When Things Get Stressful. Ask Yourself If You Thrive On Working With Deadlines Or If You Need Creative Time To Function More Effectively. Think About How You Handle Stress And Be Honest. “I Focus On The Work I’m Doing,” Or, “I Make Time To Work Out At The Gym.”</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;<b>What Salary Do You Want For This Job?</b></div><div>Rather Than Stating A Definite Figure, Tell The Interviewer You’d Expect To Get Somewhere In The Standard Range Paid For This Position .&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Do You Have Questions For Me?</b></div><div>Always Have A Few Questions. They Show That You Researched The Company. Ask About A Current Issue The Company Is Working On Or How Their Recent Layoff In Another Department Affected Company Morale.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Remember–</b> The Job Interview Is A Two-way Discovery Process. By Doing Your Homework And Answering Interview Questions Intelligently, You’re Striving To Prove You’re The Person For The Job On The Other Hand,&nbsp;you&nbsp;need To Decide–sometimes In The Midst Of The Questions—if The Position You’re Applying For Is What You Want To Do And If The Company Is Where You Want To Spend Most Of Your Time For The Next Few (at Least) Years.</div>"

For People Who Share This Problem, It’s Important To Understand The Causes And Work Towards Overcoming It.</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b></b><b>It’s Not You It’s Them</b></div><div>For Naturally Quiet People, The Fear Of Speaking Can Arise From A Few Bad Experiences, Especially At An Early Age. When An Adult Reacts Angrily Or Dismissively To An Attempt At Self Expression, It’s Natural To Take It Personally And Shy Away From Future Expression. Even If This Only Happens Once Or Twice, People Tend To Exaggerate These Incidents Until They Become Mental Monsters. Growing Up, It Took Me A Long Time To Realize How Self Centered People Are. The Way Someone Reacts To Something You Say Usually Has Nothing To Do With You–it’s More Likely A Reflection Of The Mood They’re In Or A Recent Event In Their Life.</div><div><br></div><div>A Key To Overcoming Shyness Is Recognizing These Perceived Slights For What They Are–meaningless. When Someone Reacts To You Negatively, Don’t Take It Personally. Imagine The Other Person’s Perspective. Is There Something That May Have Put Them In A Bad Mood? Are They Trying To Cover Up Their Own Inadequacy? Considering The Perspective Of The Other Person Makes It Easier To Put Their Reaction In The Proper Context.</div><div><br></div><div>It’s Also Essential To Let Go Of Bad Experiences. When You Dwell On A Bad Experience, It Grows Into Something Much More Frightening Than Reality. Don’t Do This To Yourself! The More You Think About A Bad Experience The More Power You Give It. Don’t Blame Yourself. Think About Something Constructive. The More You Can Fill Your Mind With Positive Memories Of Speaking Up The Easier It Gets.</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b></b><b>Other People Aren’t So Different</b></div><div>Another Important Step In Overcoming Shyness Is Realizing That Other People Are Basically The Same As You. Everyone Is Insecure And Afraid Of Embarrassment. Other People Usually Aren’t As Smart As You Think. If You Have A Question, Chances Are Someone Else Is Wondering About The Same Thing.</div><div><br></div><div>Don’t Let One Or Two Bad Experiences Dictate Your Entire Opinion Of Humanity. By And Large, People Are Friendly And Interested In Connecting With Others. They’ll Respond Favorably To Your Attempts At Communicating. In Most Cases, People Will Be Thrilled That You Took The Initiative To Break The Ice.</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Realizing Self Worth</b></div><div>The Second Cause Of Shyness Is Insecurity. If You Don’t Think You Have Anything Valuable To Contribute, What’s The Point Of Risking Embarrassment?</div><div><br></div><div>To Get Over This You Need To Recognize The Merit Of Your Own Thoughts And The Value They Present To Others. It’s Ironic That The People Most Inclined Towards Shyness Are Often The Most Thoughtful. To Reach Your Potential, You Need To Share Yourself With The World. Your Brilliant Insights Don’t Hold Any Value Until They’ve Enlightened Someone Else.</div><div><br></div><div>The Best Way To Get Accustomed To Sharing Is Practice. Force Yourself To Speak Up, Especially When You Don’t Want To. Sit In The Front Of The Room And Make Yourself Visible. Understand That Sharing Your Insights With People Is Doing Them A Favor. Once You Get Used To Opening Up, You’ll Notice How Positively People React. This Will&nbsp;build Your Self Confidence And Faith In The Goodwill Of Others.</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b></b><b>The Duty To Contribute</b></div><div><b>&nbsp;O</b>vercoming Shyness Isn’t Just Something You Should Do For Yourself, It’s Also Part Of Being A Contributing Member Of Society. When You Have A Thought Or Idea That Deserves To Be Heard, You’re Not Only Hurting Yourself By Keeping Quiet, You’re Hurting The People Around You.</div><div><br></div><div>A Basketball Coach Once Explained To Me How Passing Can Selfish. If A Player Has An Open Shot That She Can Make, And She Decides To Pass Instead, That Player Is Being Selfish And Hurting The Team. When You Pass Up The Chance To Excel Because Of Shyness Or The Fear Of Failure, You’re Hurting The Group To Shelter Yourself.</div><div><br></div><div>Other People Need You. They Need Your Intelligence And Insight. They Need Your Help To Work Through Problems. By Hiding Behind Shyness, You Limit The Help You Can Give To Your Friends, Family Members, And Colleagues.</div><div><br></div><div>A College Professor Of Mine Used To Make A Big Deal About Overcoming Shyness. He Called It A, “silly, Foolish Habit,” And Said, “the Sooner You Can Break It The Better.” Shyness Doesn’t Benefit Anyone. Saving Yourself A Little Embarrassment Doesn’t Amount To Much In The Long Run. By Overcoming Shyness, You Give Yourself The Chance To Be Recognized And Promoted. You Create Opportunities And Open Yourself Up To Forming Meaningful Relationships&nbsp;</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Don’t Keep Your Talent Inside, Share At Every Opportunity So It Can Grow And Flourish.</b></div>"

		"description" : "For Centuries, We’ve Talked About A Network Called The&nbsp;<b>chakra System.</b> In Terms Of Medical Intuition, These Are Emotional Centers. Why Do I Use This Term? Because I’m An Anatomist And A Physician, And Brain Anatomy Suggests That Emotions Are Wired Between The Brain And The Body. You’ll Go To Some Medical Intuitives To Talk About Energy Centers; I Talk About Emotional Centers, But I Also Include Energy. Each Center, Whatever You Want To Call It, Corresponds To An Area Of Your Physical Anatomy. Each Center Has A Life Situation And An Emotion That Affects An Area Of The Body.<div><br></div><div>This Is The Map That’s Going To Help You Create Health. Yes, It Is.</div><div><br></div><div>There Are Seven Regions In This Emotional/energy Center System.</div><div><br></div><div>These Are The Seven Regions:</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>1. </b>First Center:Bones, Blood, Immune System, Skin, Joints, And Muscle. This Physical Region Is Affected By The Health Of Our Family Or Other Groups Of People.</div><div><br></div><div>2. Second Center:Reproductive Organs Like Uterus, Ovaries, Vagina, Prostate, Testes, Lower Back, Hips, And Bladder. This Area Is Associated With Concerns About Love And Money.</div><div><br></div><div><b>3.</b> Third Center:Digestive Tract—esophagus, Stomach, Liver, Gallbladder, Colon, Rectum, Metabolism, Pancreas, Body Image. This Area Is Influenced By Self-esteem, Work, Feeling Good Enough.</div><div><br></div><div>4. Fourth Center:Heart, Breast, Lungs. This Region Has To Do With Health, Nurturance , And Partnerships.</div><div><br></div><div><b>5</b>. Fifth Center:Neck, Thyroid, Mouth, Teeth, Jaw. This Area Is Influenced By Our Communication Style And Our Healthy Capacity To Handle Timing.</div><div><br></div><div><b>6</b>. Sixth Center:Head, Eyes, Ears, Brain. This Area Relates To Perception, Thought, And Basic Mental Health.</div><div><br></div><div><b>7.</b> Seventh Center:Life-threatening Illnesses, Or Events In Our Lives That Bring Us To Our Knees. Not A Discrete Area Of The Physical Body But Affecting Many Parts Of The Body, This Region Has To Do With Spirituality And Life Purpose.</div><div>As You Make A Note Of The Areas Where You Have Problems, You’re Doing Your Own Medical Intuitive Reading. By Noting Which Area Of The Body You Have Most Of Your Problems In, You Will Begin To Know Where Most Of Your Emotions Are Patterned.</div><div><br></div><div>In My Book With Louise Hay, Called&nbsp;Heal Your Mind,&nbsp;we Show You How To Give Yourself Your Own Medical Intuitive Reading&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>What Is Medical Intuition? In Medical Intuition, Certain Areas Of Your Body Let You Know When Emotion Has Built Up In A Certain Area Of Your Life. Certain Organs In Your Body Intuitively Will Let You Know That Something That’s Emotionally Bothering You Needs To Change.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;So, If It’s Depression About A Family Member, Anger About A Relative, Anger About A Mate, Frustration About Money, Or Anxiety About Work, And So On And So On, Certain Areas Of Your Body Will Murmur, Nudge, Or Scream Loudly When That Area Of Your Emotional Life Needs To Change.Medical Intuition Lets Us Look At The Function Of The Brain Alongside These Seven Centers As Part Of The Larger Mind-body Network. So Your Right Brain Is Made Up Half Of Your Emotions And Half Of Your Intuition. Your Left Brain Is For Language, That Is, Putting Your Feelings And Intuition Into Words And Action.</div><div><br></div><div>So, For Health, If You Can’t Take Your Feelings From The Right Brain, Name Them, Respond Effectively, And Release Them, Your Health Is Going To Let You Know Medical-intuitively. Your Right Brain Emotion And Intuition Will Travel Down To Your Body, Into One Or More Of Those Seven Centers, And Talk To You Through Symptoms Of Disease.</div><div><br></div><div><b>HOW EMOTION TRANSLATES TO THE BODY&nbsp;</b></div><div>So, Now You Know That Your Body Will Tell You, Through Symptoms Of Health, When Areas In Your Family, Relationship, Money, And Work Are Going Great. Or, Intuitively, Your Body Will Let You Know Through Health Problems That Those Areas In Your Life Aren’t Going Great. You Can Learn How To Listen To The&nbsp;beginnings&nbsp;of Your Feelings In Your Right Brain, The Area For Intuition; How To Detect The <b>beginning Of Sadness Before It Turns To Depression</b>. The&nbsp;<b>beginning Of Fear Before It Turns To Panic And Anxiety</b>.&nbsp;The&nbsp;<b>beginning Of Ange</b>r Before It Turns To Frustration And Meltdown. Before These Emotions Affect Your Health, Your Attention, And Ultimately Other Areas Of Your Brain.</div><div><br></div><div>So Let’s Do A Hypothetical Reading (or Maybe Not So Hypothetical, Since These Issues Are So Common To All Of Us):</div><div><br></div><div><b>• Look At The Areas&nbsp;on&nbsp;your Reading</b>: <b>did You Circle The First Center, For Problems Such As Immune Disorders Like Allergies Or Infections?</b>&nbsp;If You Did, Then Ask Yourself, What’s My Family Like? Do I Have A Lot Of Friends? Do I Feel Safe And Secure In The World?</div><div><br></div><div><b>• Or Did You Circle The Second Center Areas—lower Back, Uterus, Ovaries, Hormones, Or Reproductive System?</b>&nbsp;If You Did, Then Ask Yourself, Am I Depressed About A Relationship? Frustrated About My Sex Life? And How About Those Finances—am I Worried Or Stressed About Money?</div><div><br></div><div><b>• Or Maybe You Circled The Third Center For Digestion, Weight, Body Image, Kidneys.&nbsp;Then You May Have To Sit Yourself Down And Ask Yourself, How Is That Job Going?</b> What Is The State Of My Self-esteem: Do I Think I’m Fat? Do I Hate My Hair? Do I Find Myself Attractive?</div><div><br></div><div><b>• Or Have You Been Having Problems With Sinusitis, Bronchitis, Lungs, Heart, Cholesterol, Hypertension, Heart Palpitations, Or Breast Lumps In The Fourth Center?</b>&nbsp;Then You’re Going To Have To Sit Yourself Down And Ask Yourself What Your Partnerships Are Like, Or Your Relationship To Your Mother Or Your Children.</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>• Or Do You Have Neck Pain, Thyroid Problems, TMJ Problems, Gum Or Tooth Disease?&nbsp;</b>Well, I Hate To Tell You, But Communication May Be An Issue.</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>• Then&nbsp;there’s&nbsp;the Head, Eyes, And Ears. Do You Have Dizziness, Vertigo, Dry Eyes, Headaches, Or Health Concerns Here?</b>&nbsp;You May Have Problems With How You See The World And Your Ability To Change How You Respond To It.</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>• Then There’s The Seventh Center.</b>&nbsp;We Need To Pause Here, Because These Health Problems Will Make You Stop In Your Tracks In Your Life. Chronic, Hard-to-treat, Even Life-threatening Illnesses Force You To Focus On What Your Purpose In Life Is. Or Have You Lost Your Purpose? Have You Lost Your Focus? And What Is The Quality Of Your Spiritual Life?</div><div><br></div><div>So When It Comes To Combining Medical Intuition And Affirmations, We Identify A Scenario In Our Life (family, Relationships, Work, And So On), We Identify The Emotion (anger, Fear, Sadness, Anxiety, And So On), And We Identify The Health Problem That It Involves. These Are The Three Angles Of The Triangle.</div><div><br></div><div>In My Book With <b>Louise Hay,&nbsp;Heal Your Mind</b>,&nbsp;we Show You How To Heal Your Mind, Creating Wholeness With Medicine, Affirmations, And Intuition. We Need All Three Of These To Heal.

And after learning,I will build a really great car that will make everyone want it.Mother:Learning to build a car is very difficult and sweetie,it’s not at all for girls.You should learn to cook cakes,cookies and other delicious food. That will make everyone really happy and want your food.We’re living in 21st century and yet,women taking technical jobs is still dissented by the society. Although,women empowerment has been one of the most marked moments this century and a large number of women are getting their rights to education,yet according to a survey,of all the working women in the world,only a smattering of them are involved in technical jobs/fields. For instance,In India itself,where a large part of the society wants to pursue engineering, only 8 percent of women give the entrance examination and out of these only 6 percent actually take admission in one such college.What is the reason for such a low number. It’s not like we’re just comparing boys to girls here,but also women to other women.On asking this question from a number of people,we get answers like “women lack passion for technology”,”technology is something cannot be understood by women”,“they lack the know-how”,”women and machines can never go together”. These stereotypical thoughts have rather become accepted social norms. Or rather these are the reasons people come up with to hide the fact that they want women to be more focused on family rather than science.Due to all these obstructions,various steps are undertaken by the government and people all over the world to indulge more women into the technical fields. Some of these include lowering the fee for girls for engineering entrance examinations,opening up all girls college engineering college for example, Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University. Then there’s another world-wide moment “Lean In” initiated by Sheryl Sandberg,COO of Facebook that encourages all women in the world to follow their dreams without letting anyone telling them “No,you can’t do this.”I think,as part of the society all we need to do is just support whatever a woman really wants to achieve in her life without deliberately creating obstruction in their paths.

For Example, If Someone Is Hungry, They Won’t Be Able To Concentrate On A Critical Thinking Task. In This Case You’ll Need To Make Sure That This Person Has Had Lunch Before The Task Needs To Be Completed. But How Can You Motivate Them To Complete Certain Tasks Once Base Needs Have Been Fulfilled?</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Try One Or More Of The Following Ways Of Motivating People:</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>1.&nbsp;Treat People Kindly.</b>&nbsp;As A Leader You Need To Treat The People Helping You With The Utmost Respect And Kindness.&nbsp;Hand Out Praise When It’s Warranted.&nbsp;You Might Not Know It, But It’s A Big Motivation Booster When People Are Treated Right. People Enjoy Knowing When They’re Doing A Good Job And Enjoy Working With People That Treat Others With Kindness.</div><div><br></div><div><b>2.&nbsp;Give People Responsibility.</b>&nbsp;If There Are Certain Tasks That You’re Allowed To Delegate To Others, By All Means Choose Someone To Take Responsibility For That Task. When People Are Fully Responsible, They’ll Be More Likely To Find The Motivation To Complete The Task. This Is Because, As A Part Of A Group, They May Not Feel Like Their Hard Work Matters, But When They’re Responsible It Certainly Matters. They Also Know That They’re Being Held Accountable For The Success Or Failure Of The Project.</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>3.&nbsp;Be A Good Listener.&nbsp;</b>No One Likes To Feel Like They Don’t Matter. Just Because You Have Final Say Doesn’t Mean That You Can’t Get Some Help With Important Decision Making.&nbsp;People Enjoy Feeling Like They’re Making A Difference.&nbsp;Always Keep An Open Ear And You’ll Be Motivating Your Team To Come Up With Solutions And Creative Ideas.</div><div><br></div><div><b>4.&nbsp;Set Stretched Goals.</b>&nbsp;Think Long And Hard About How Your Goal Setting Abilities Can Teach You How To Motivate Others. You Don’t Want To Set Goals That Are Too Easy. Your Team Might Reach Them Quickly But They Won’t Be Pushed To Become The Best They Can Be. On The Other End, You Don’t Want To Set Goals That Are Unattainable Either. Your Team Will Quickly Lose Motivation Because They’ll Never Get The Feeling Of Having Met Their Goals. You Want To Find A Goal That Would Push Them To Achieve Just A Little More Than They Have In The Past And Keep Going From There.</div><div><br></div><div><b>5.&nbsp;Get To Know People.</b>&nbsp;You May Not Want To Be Personal Friends With Your Colleagues, But That Doesn’t Mean That You Can’t Get To Know Them As People. Keep Lines Of Communication Open And Get To Know Your Team By Paying Attention To Their Wants, Needs, Strengths And Weaknesses. People Are Smart And They’ll Know When They Have A Leader That Cares And A Leader That Doesn’t. They’ll Certainly Be More Motivated To Work Hard For Somebody That Cares About Them.</div><div><br></div><div><b>6.&nbsp;Keep Everyone In The Know.&nbsp;</b>Nobody Likes To Be Left In The Dark. Make Sure That You’re Open About Your Thinking And Decisions With The People You’re Motivating. Sure, Sometimes There Will Be Things That You’re Not Supposed To Share. You Just Need To Make An Effort To Spread The Word Around When You Can Communicate Important Issues.</div><div><br></div><div>Remember That When You’re Working On Motivating Others, It’s Definitely Important To <i>strengthen Their Sense Of Belonging</i>.&nbsp;You’re Leading A Little Family And When Everyone’s Happy, They’re Motivated To Achieve Big Things.</div>"

The names nanobots, nanoide, nanites, nanomachines or nanomites have been used to describe certain types of devices which is currently under research and technology.Nano machines are largely in the research, technology and development phase, but some primitive molecular machines have been tested. An example of nano machine is a sensor having a switch approximately 1.5 nanometers across, the capable of counting specific molecules in a chemical sample. The first useful application of nano machines might be used in medical technology, which could be used to identify and destroy the cancer cells.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;Another potential application is the detection of toxic chemicals, and the measurements of their concentrations, in the environment. Recently, Rice University has been demonstrated a single molecule car developed by a chemical process and including bucky balls for wheels. It is actuated by monitoring the environmental temperature and by positioning a scanning tunneling microscope tip.Fit for another definition is a robot that allows precision interactions with nano scale objects, or can manipulate with nano scale resolution.

It Seems Insane, Because Of Course, We&nbsp;want&nbsp;to Reach Our Goals, Right? I Mean, Don’t We?</i><div><br></div><div>The Short Answer Is That Yes, We Do Want To Accomplish Our Goals, But That It’s Complicated.&nbsp;<b>There Are Several Factors That Complicate Our Relationship With Achievement.</b>&nbsp;For Example, We May Fear That Pursuing Our Goals Might Cause Tension Between Ourselves And Our Family, Friends, And Other Acquaintances. People Close To Us Can Exacerbate This By Scolding Us For Having A Big Head, Being Too Big For Our Britches, Or Thinking We’re Better Than Them. Success Can Feel Like Abandoning The People We Care About.</div><div><br></div><div>Or We Might Fear The Way That Accomplishing Something Big Opens Us Up To Criticism. Even One Negative Review Among Dozens Of Positives Can Feel Like Failure If We’re Deeply-enough Invested Into A Project’s Outcome. Accomplishment Also Brings With It Heightened Expectations, New Responsibilities, And New Goals More Difficult Than The Ones Just Realized — All Of Which Can Cause Us To Fear The Accomplishment Itself.</div><div><br></div><div>Finally, Our Projects Are Often So Much A Part Of Ourselves That Finishing Feels Like A Death Of Sorts — What Will I Do, Or More Importantly, Who Will I Be When I No Longer Have My Novel/dissertation/degree/start-up/other Big Project To Define My Days And My Self? That’s A Pretty Big Whammy!</div><div><br></div><div><b>Success And Other People</b>&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Working On Any Big Project Can Cause Conflict With The People Around&nbsp; Us. There Are Practical Concerns — Not Being Able To Socialize, For Instance, Or Neglecting Day-to-day Chores To Work On Our Life’s Work — And There Are Emotional Ones — Feeling Selfish About Choosing Your Work Over Your Family And Friends, For Example. This Is Why It’s Vitally Important To Build Relationships With Supportive People (and Be Genuinely Supportive In Return) And To&nbsp;nourish&nbsp;those Relationships No Matter What Else Is Going&nbsp; On.</div><div><br></div><div><b>No Matter How Big A Project Or Goal, We&nbsp;must&nbsp;make Time For Socializing, Relaxing, And Playing.</b>&nbsp;For One&nbsp; Thing, Non-work Time Can Be Just As Crucial To Our Success As The Time We Spend Directly Working Towards Our Goals, Because It Recharges Our Batteries And Lets Our Minds Move Our Work To An Unconscious Part Of Our Mind Where It Often Continues To Work (ts Is Why The Solution To So Many Problems Pops Into Our Heads As Soon As We Stop Thinking About Them). But Just As Important, This “together Time” With The People Who Matter To Us Strengthens Our Relationships And Lets Them Know That They Are A Big Part Of The Life You’re Working Toward Your Goals To Create.</div><div><br></div><div>Of Course, There Are Always One Or Two Emotional Vampires Who, Because Of Jealousy, Resentment, Or Just An Overly Negative Nature, Will Never Be Quite Satisfied. If You Can Cut Them Loose, Do So — Life’s Too Short To Try To Please Theunpleasable . If You Can’t, Though — If They’re Family, For Example — Then Do What You Can To Firewall Them From Your Life While You’re Working, And Let The Results Speak For Themselves Down The Line. If You Can Learn To See Their Negativity As Their Problem, Not Yours, All The Better.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Fear Of Falling&nbsp;</b></div><div>Not Achieving Our Goals Has Something Really Big Going For It — If You Don’t Get Off The Ground, It Won’t Hurt If You Fall. Striving For Success Always Involves A Risk — And The Higher You Climb, The Farther You Have To Fall. Dreaming Without Acting Can Even Be Soothing: We Can Dream Of A Brighter Future Without Risking Anything. At Least For A While.</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>A Fear Of Failure Or Of Negative Criticism Can Instill In Us A Perfectionism That Leads Us To Shy Away From Finishing A Big Project, And Even From&nbsp;starting.&nbsp;</b>We Internalize And Amplify The Criticism We Expect, And Almost Always Find Ourselves Lacking. “Who Am I To Attempt Something This Big?” Our Inner Critic Asks — And All-too-often, Answers, “Nobody.”While That Inner Critic May Not Be Totally Unavoidable, You Can Make An End-run Around It By Giving Yourself&nbsp;permission To Suck. Realize That Some Of The Greatest Works Of Art Were Profoundly Disappointing To Their Creators, That The Greatest Entrepreneurs Are Always Striving To Make Their Companies Better, That Some Of The Most Brilliant Scientists Of All Time Made Incredible Mistakes. Einstein Almost Undermined His Entire Theory Of Relativity By Adding A Cosmological Constant To His Formulae Because He Couldn’t Accept What His Work Was Telling Him About The Universe. Bill Gates Became The Richest Person In The World Releasing Software That Consistently Failed To Live Up To Expectations.</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Who Do You Want To Be Today?</b></div><div>The Biggest Psychic Beast Roaming The Jungles Of Our Mind Is The Fear Of The Unknown That Comes When We’re Done With Whatever Big Project We’re Working On. In It’s Mild Form, It Is Simply A Fear Of Deferred Failure — We May Succeed In The Short Term, But That Success Will Give Way To More And Greater Projects That Will, Eventually, Overwhelm Us.</div><div><br></div><div>In Its More Chronic Form, This Is A Fear Of Becoming Someone Else — Finishing A Novel Makes Us An Author, Finishing A Dissertation Makes Us A Doctor, Building A Company Makes Us A CEO, And So On. Life May Be Better, We Hope — But It Will Also Be Different. Our Lives Will Change In Ways We Cannot Imagine, And That’s Pretty Scary!</div><div><br></div><div>It’s Important To Remember, Though, That Life Doesn’t Work Like It Plays Out In Our Imaginations.&nbsp;<b>We Don’t Suddenly Jump From Wherever We Are Into Some Unknown Future Where We Have No Idea What We’re Doing.&nbsp;</b>The Responsibilities That Might Evolve From The Successful Completion Of A Big Project Will Build On The Skills And Talents We Developed In Executing That Project. That Is, The Entrepreneur Hustling To Make Her First Big Sale Today Isn’t Going To Be The CEO Of Her Company When It’s Successful; The CEO Will Be The Person She Gradually Becomes As She Amasses Experience And Know-how In The Course Of Building Her Company.</div><div><br></div><div><b>But Most Important Of All, We Need To Cultivate Joy And Satisfaction In The Work Itself — And In Our Lives As They Are.</b>&nbsp;That Might Seem Counter-intuitive; After All, Why Strive To Improve Your Life If You’re Satisfied With It As It Is? But How Can We Expect To Be Satisfied With Some Unknown Future Life If We Can’t Be Satisfied With The Life We Already Know? We Have To Replace The Notion Of A Better Tomorrow With A Sense Of Purpose, With Each Step Towards That Purpose Being Equally As Important As The Next And The Last. It’s Not That Who You Are Today Is Lacking, Somehow, But That Who You Are Today Is Essential To The Realization Of Your Life’s Purpose.</div><div><br></div><div>Where You Get That Sense Of Purpose Will Differ From Person To Person. For Some, It Is Religion; For Others, A Commitment To Their Art; For Still Others, Humanitarian Ideals; And Others Will Find Purpose In The Face Of Their Newborn Child, Their Spouse, Or Their Parents. Each Of Us Has Our Own Path To Walk, And Each Of Us Has To&nbsp;find It On Our Own&nbsp;— Though There Are Plenty Of Markers Out There If You Just Look, Given That The Quest For Purpose Is Humanity’s Oldest Preoccupation After The Sheer Fact Of Survival. And Even Just Accepting That There Is&nbsp;some&nbsp;purpose In Your Life, Without Necessarily Knowing What It Is, Can Be A Huge Motivator — That Alone Can Give You Wings And Help Overcome The Fear That Keeps You From Using Them.</div>"

The Place Where I Tell You Exactly How To Grab Hold Of Creativity – And Put It To Good Use. There’s Just One Small Problem: Creativity Isn’t Like That. At All. We Can’t Grab Hold Of Creativity.

The More Tricks We Use To Get Our Creativity Under Control, The More It Seems To Vanish – And We Are Left With A Dreary Laundry List Of Laudable Writing Skills.

The Doorway Leads To Nothing, Nada, Nichts. What I Mean Is This: Creativity Happens When We Embrace Darkness And Give Up Knowing. Not Knowing Means That We Need To Feel Our Way In The Darkness.

There Is No Knowledge To Support Us, And No Known Outcome Of Our Work. It’s Like A Mute Having A Dream – But Not Able To Express It.&nbsp; Isadora Duncan Said, “If I Could Say It I Wouldn’t Have To Dance It.” It’s Uncomfortable. But It’s Also Pure Adventure.

Because We Tend To Ride On The Rail Of Who We Think We Are, And Who We Want To Appear As. If We Want To Touch And Reveal Our Creative Soul, We Need To Allow Creativity To Derail Us. Yes, We’ll Be Faced With Something Of A Crash Site With Passengers Wandering Around Aimlessly Wondering Who The Hell They Are And How They Got There. But Touching The Soul Of Creativity Is Worth The Chaos And The Pain.</div><div><br></div><div>If You Walk Through This Dark Doorway,&nbsp; You’ll Renew Your Love Affair With Writing. You’ll Find That You Never Lost Your Creativity – It’s Right There, Just Waiting For You To Let Go Of Knowing, Productivity, And Usefulness.</div><div><br></div><div>Ok, So It’s Not The Kind Of Writing That Productivity Gurus Talk About. If You’re A Blogger Who Has To Produce Stuff Regularly, It May&nbsp; Not Be A Technique For Everyday Writing, But You May Want To Use It At Least Once A Month To Keep On Developing As A Writer. It’s Slow, Laborious, Heart-rending, And Exhilarating – And Will Remind You Why You Wanted To Become A Writer In The First Place.</div>"

		"description" : "<b>“Wisely, And Slow. They Stumble That Run Fast.”</b><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; –<b> William Shakespeare</b><div><br></div><div><i>How Many Times Have You Rushed Into Making Changes In Your Life — A Habit Change, Learning A New Skill — Only To Have It Flop?</i></div><div><br></div><div>It’s Not Just The New Year’s Resolution Syndrome — It Happens Too Often At All Times Of The Year, That We Run Out Of Steam Or Get Discouraged And Give Up.</div><div><br></div><div>But Here’s The Secret, And I Won’t Charge You $29.95 For It: Go Slowly.</div><div><br></div><div>This Little Change Has More Power Than Most People Realize. It Will Help To Learn Any Skill, From Martial Arts To Art To Computer Activities. It Will Help Form Habits That Are Long-lasting. Slowing Down Will Help You Become More Effective And Ironically, Help Reach Goals Faster.</div><div><br></div><div>If You’ve Ever Tried T’ai Chi (or Taijiquan), Famous For Its Series Of Slow Movements And Poses, You’ve Felt The Power Of Slow. The Slower You Go In T’ai Chi, The Better, For Many Reasons. One Effect Of This Slowness Is That You Perfect The Movements. And Your Body Adapts, Forming Muscle Memories That Will Last When (and If) You Decide To Speed Up The Movements.</div><div><br></div><div>It’s As If Your Body And Mind Are Forming A Groove Through Continual Repetition Of The Movements. If You Move Quickly, You’ll Be Erratic, And The Groove Will Be Much More Difficult To Form. If You Move Slowly, You Can Learn To Move In Exactly The Same Pattern, In A More Precise Way, And A Groove Will Form. Once The Groove Is Formed, It Becomes Easier. <i>It’s Now Habit, Unconscious Memory, And Automatic.</i></div><div><br></div><div>This Is Habit Formation, And Usually It’s Done Without Thought. When We Drive Home And Our Minds Are On Something Else, But We Make The Right Motions To Get Home Anyway … This Is Habit, This Is Our Minds And Bodies Going In A Groove We’ve Formed By Doing These Actions So Many Times Before.</div><div><br></div><div>The Groove Is Best Formed By Going Slow, At First.</div><div><br></div><div>This Applies To Anything: Exercise, Eating Healthy, Creating Art, Becoming A Patient Parent, Carpentry, Reading. Slow Is The Secret To Making It Last. And No, That’s Not Meant To Be Dirty.</div><div><br></div><div>Some Of The Reasons Slow Works, Besides Forming A Groove:</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>1. Mindfulness.</b> When You Do Something Slowly, You Can Pay More Attention To What You’re Doing. I Highly Recommend That When You Make Changes, You Do Them Mindfully, With Full Concentration. This Increased Awareness Is Necessary In The Beginning, When You’re Still Forming The Groove. Later, It’ll Become Automatic, But At First It’s Anything But. You Need To Pay Attention, And You Can Do This Better When You Do It Slower.</div><div><br></div><div><b>2. You Hold Yourself Back</b>. Holding Ourselves Back Is Often Considered A Bad Thing, But It’s Not. It’s The Best Thing We Can Do, If We Want Changes To Last. When We Start A New Change, Often We Are Full Of Enthusiasm. But Then We Go All Out And Use Up All Of That Enthusiasm, And Run Out Of Motivation Or Energy Or Get Distracted By Something Else. But When You Hold Yourself Back, You Build Up Enthusiasm And Keep It Going For Much Longer — Through That Dreaded 2-3 Week Barrier When People Often Quit. So Even If You Want To Run 3 Miles At First, Start With Walking And Then Run-walking (in Intervals), And Only Do A Mile Or So. You’ll Want To Do More, But Stop Yourself. Save That Enthusiasm For Next Time.</div><div><br></div><div>3. You Learn It Right. Doing Something Slowly Means You Can Learn To Do It Correctly, Without Being Erratic, And Later As It Becomes Second Nature You’ll Do It The Right Way. The Importance Is Obvious In Something Like Martial Arts, But It’s Also True In Any Physical Activity. And Every Activity Is Physical (and Mental).</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>4. Increased Focus</b>. When You Do Something Slowly, You Tend To Do Just One Thing. It’s Hard To Multi-task And Do Something Slowly — They Don’t Mix Well. When You Single-task, You Can Focus, Instead Of Always Being Distracted. This Leads To Increased Effectiveness.</div><div><br></div><div><b>5. Calm. Slow Is Calmer.</b> Fast Is Hectic. Go Slow To Get Rid Of The Chaos, And Find Peace.</div><div><b><i><br></i></b></div><div><b><i>“Slow Down, Everyone. You’re Moving Too Fast.”&nbsp;– Jack Johnson</i></b></div></div>"

For Your Physical And Mental Health. For Your Relationships. For Your Ability To Move On Peacefully And Productively.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Why Forgiveness Instead Of Revenge?</b></div><div><br></div><div><i>Christina M. Puchalski, M.D. </i>is The Founder And Director Of The George Washington Institute For Spirituality And Health And Assistant Professor Of Medicine At The George Washington University School Of Medicine. She Says:</div><div><br></div><div>\"On A Personal Level, Forgiveness Of Self Can Help Us Achieve An Inner Peace As Well As Peace With Others And With God. Wrongdoing Against Others And Ourselves Can Result In Guilt And Resentment.&nbsp; This Can Then Lead To Self-recrimination And Self-loathing; It Also Can Create A Distance Or Disconnect From Self And Others. Resentment Can Give Away To Hate And Intolerance. Forgiveness Is The First Stage Of Self-love And Acceptance. It Is Also The Basic Building Block Of Loving Relationships With Others.</div><div><br></div><div><b>\"It's Not The Offense. It's Your Response To It.</b></div><div><br></div><div>I Confess, I'm Not Always A Quick-to-forgive Person Once I've Felt \"wronged\". I Give People A Very Long Leash And A Long Time To \"get Their Act Together\" If Things Aren't Going Well. But There Is Some Point At Which I Just Say \"that's It\" And Cut Them Off From My Life. It Is Very Infrequent, But The Pattern Is Always The Same. I Decide That The Differences Are Irreconcilable. So, The Relationship&nbsp;in Its Present Form&nbsp;is Finished.</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Does That Serve Me Well?</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>&nbsp;</b>Only If I Genuinely Forgive. It Is Both Possible And Imperative To Do That And, At The Same Time, Acknowledge That The&nbsp;nature Of&nbsp;the Relationship May Not Be Productive. This Is The Harder Part, I Think. It Begs The Nagging Question, \"If I Can Forgive, Why Can't I Just Continue?</div><div><br></div><div>\"Sometimes It's Possible. More Often, It Becomes Apparent That I Wasn't Seeing Clearly To Begin With And That Continuing The Relationship--without Changing Expectations--would Not Be Peaceful Or Productive For Either Of Us.</div><div><br></div><div>Dr. Frederic Luskin Specializes In Learning To Forgive. He Explains That:</div><div><br></div><div>\"The Practice Of Forgiveness Has Been Shown To Reduce Anger, Hurt Depression And Stress And Leads To Greater Feelings Of Hope, Peace, Compassion And Self Confidence. Practicing Forgiveness Leads To Healthy Relationships As Well As Physical Health.</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>\"Dr. Luskin's 9 Steps To Forgiveness</b></div><div><br></div><div><b>1.&nbsp;</b>Know Exactly How You Feel About What Happened And Be Able To Articulate What About The Situation Is Not OK. Then, Tell A Trusted Couple Of People About Your Experience.</div><div><br></div><div><b>2.</b> Make A Commitment To Yourself To Do What You Have To Do To Feel Better. Forgiveness Is For You And Not For Anyone Else.</div><div><br></div><div>3. Forgiveness Does Not Necessarily Mean Reconciliation With The Person That Hurt You, Or Condoning Their Action. What You Are After Is To Find Peace. Forgiveness Can Be Defined As The \"peace And Understanding That Come From Blaming That Which Has Hurt You Less, Taking The Life Experience Less Personally, And Changing Your Grievance Story.\"</div><div><br></div><div><b>4</b>. Get The Right Perspective On What Is Happening. Recognize That Your Primary Distress Is Coming From The Hurt Feelings, Thoughts And Physical Upset You Are Suffering Now, Not What Offended You Or Hurt You Two Minutes--or Ten Years Ago. Forgiveness Helps To Heal Those Hurt Feelings.</div><div><br></div><div><b>5.</b> At The Moment You Feel Upset Practice A Simple Stress Management Technique To Soothe Your Body's Fight Or Flight Response.</div><div><br></div><div><b>6. </b>Give Up Expecting Things From Other People, Or Your Life, That They Do Not Choose To Give You. Recognize That \"unenforceable Rules\" You Have For Your Health Or How You Or Other People Must Behave. Remind Yourself That You Can Hope For Health, Love, Peace And Prosperity And Work Hard To Get Them.</div><div><br></div><div><b>7.</b> Put Your Energy Into Looking For Another Way To Get Your Positive Goals Met Than Through The Experience That Has Hurt You. Instead Of Mentally Replaying Your Hurt Seek Out New Ways To Get What You Want.</div><div><br></div><div><b>8.</b> Remember That A Life Well Lived Is Your Best Revenge. Instead Of Focusing On Your Wounded Feelings, And Thereby Giving The Person Who Caused You Pain Power Over You, Learn To Look For The Love, Beauty And Kindness Around You.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>9.</b> Amend Your Grievance Story To Remind You Of The Heroic Choice To Forgive.If You Would Like To Explore Other Resources, Check Out&nbsp;The <b>Forgiveness Web</b>&nbsp; And&nbsp;<b>Forgiveness Net.</b></div>"

So, Give Them A Gift Worth More Than Money.Next Time Someone Asks You For Money, Don’t Try To Ignore Them. Turn To Them, Smile Warmly And Tell Them How You Feel. If You Don’t Feel Like Giving Money, Just Tell Them “Sorry, I Don’t Have Change Now. Have A Beautiful Day!”Similarly, If Something Is Trying To Sell You Something Or ‘hitting-on’ You, Simply Turn To Them, Smile And Say “No Thank You.”I’ve Found That It Takes More Energy To Ignore And Pretend To Be Very Serious, Than It Is To Smile.

And Once I’ve Achieved A Goal, I Begin Looking For Another: Now That I Finished My Second Marathon, I’m Already Looking For A Third.</div><div><br></div><div>So Isn’t That A Contradiction? Doesn’t That Seem To Indicate That I’m Not Content With My Life? Not At All. I’m Extremely Content With My Life, With What I Have, And With Who I Am. I Have Accepted That I Am The Type Of Person Who Will Always Be Striving For A Goal, The Type Of Person Who Enjoys A Challenge, And Who Enjoys The Journey. It’s Not The Goal That Matters To Me — It’s The Journey To Get There That Is So Fun. And I’m Content With Being That Type Of Person.</div><div><br></div><div>So Contentment Isn’t A Matter With Being Content With Your Situation In Life And Never Trying To Improve It. It’s A Matter Of Being Content With What You Have — But Realizing That As Humans, We Will Always Try To Improve, No Matter How Happy We Are. If We Don’t, We Have Given Up On Life.</div><div><br></div><div>Today I’d Like To Discuss Contentment, And The Amazing Things It Can Do In All Aspects Of Our Lives.

Looking Back, I Wasn’t Always Content. There Have Been Times In My Life When I Wasn’t Happy, When Things Seemed Dismal, When I Wish I Had More. I Wasn’t Content With The Way Things Were, And Now I Know That My Outlook On Life Was A Major Contributor To My Unhappiness.</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>We Choose Whether We Are Happy Or Unhappy.</b> Read That Sentence Again If It’s Not Already Something You Consciously Practice In Your Daily Life.

That Sounds Harsh, But In My Experience It’s Completely True.&nbsp;<i>Edit Based On Reader Comments:</i> I Cannot Speak To Whether This Concept Of Happiness Applies To Everyone — Especially Clinically Depressed Or Those With Similar Disorders, People Who Are Starving Or Homeless, People Who Have Undergone Massive Tragedies Or Abuse, Or Others In Such Circumstances. However, For Most Readers, I Believe The Principles Will Apply.</div><div><br></div><div>You Might Say, “But My Life Is Crap! Of Course I’m Going To Be Unhappy!” And I Hear You: I’ve Had Those Times When My Job Wasn’t Going Well, When My Relationships Weren’t Going Well, When My Finances Were Very Bad, When I Was Overweight, When My Life Was A Mess.</div><div><br></div><div>But Listen To This: I’ve Had Those Conditions At Several Points In My Life. And Sometimes, I Was Unhappy In Those Kinds Of Conditions. And Others, I Was Happy And Content. So I’ve Come To The Conclusion — And It’s Proven True Time And Again — That It’s Not The Conditions That Make Me Unhappy, But My Choice Of Thoughts, Of Attitude, Of Behavior.</div><div><br></div><div>What Behaviors And Thoughts And Attitudes Were Different Between My Times Of Unhappiness And Happiness? When I Was Unhappy, I Focused On All The Bad Things In My Life. Not Only That, But I Continually Thought About How Bad They Were, And Would Complain, And Would Ask, “Why Me?” I Would Let Myself Sink Into Inaction And Eventually Depression. I Would Be Grumpy And Cause Those Around Me To Be Unhappy. That, In Turn, Only Made The Situation Worse. It Certainly Didn’t Help My Job.</div><div><br></div><div>Let’s Look At The Times Of Happiness, In Contrast: I Focused Instead On The Good Things In My Life. Because While I Had Problems At My Job And With My Relationships And With My Finances And Health And All That … There Were Still Good Things. At Least I Had A Job! At Least I Had Someone Who Loved Me! At Least I Wasn’t Sick! At Least I Wasn’t Bankrupt And Homeless! I Counted, Instead, My Blessings. I Do This When Things Aren’t Looking So Good, And It Turns Me Around.</div><div><br></div><div>I Had A Wife And Beautiful Children. I Had The Power To Change My Job. To Simplify My Life. To Get Out Of Debt. I Had My Health, Even If I Was Overweight. I Lived On A Beautiful Island With Gorgeous Beaches And Wildlife And Greenery. I Had Family Around Me Who Loved Me. I Had The Power Of My Words, And My Books That I Loved Reading. I Had Life</div><div><br></div><div>!And This Outlook On Life Helped Me To Be Happier. It Improved My Relationship, Because I Tried To Apprecate My Wife. It Improved Everything Around Me, In Short — And We’ll Take A Closer Look At Those Things Next.</div><div><br></div><div>I Was Happy, Despite My Conditions, Because I Chose To Be Happy. I Found Contentment In What I Already Had, Instead Of Wishing I Had Something Else, Instead Of Being Discontented With What I Had. Contentment Not Only Made Me Happy, But It Transformed My Life In Many Ways. Here’s How.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Happiness</b></div><div>This Is Perhaps The Most Obvious Area Affected On This List, Because Many People See “contentedness” And “happiness” As One And The Same. In Many Ways, They Are, But It’s Really A Matter Of Focus. When You’re Happy, It’s Really A State Of Being, Influenced By A Number Of Factors, Including Contentedness.</div><div><br></div><div>Contentedness, On The Other Hand, Is A Matter Of Being Satisfied With What You Have. It Focuses On What You Have And Don’t Have Instead Of Just Being A State Of Being. It Influences Happiness. However, You Can Choose To Be Content, Just As You Can Choose To Be Happy, And If You Choose To Be Content, You Will Be Happy.</div><div><br></div><div>There Are Many Ways To Become Happy — You Can Become Happy By Doing Certain Things (running, Getting Into Flow, Sex), You Can Become Happy Because You Are Loved Or In Love, You Can Become Happy Because You Just Won A Competition Or A Million Dollars. Being Content Is Just One Way To Be Happy, But It’s A Great Way.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Simplicity</b></div><div><br></div><div>Simplicity, Of Course, Means Many Things To Many People, But For Me Contentedness Is At The Core Of Simplicity. It’s About Being Content With Less, With A Simpler Life, Rather Than Always Wanting More, Always Acquiring More, And Never Being Content.</div><div><br></div><div>Simplicity Means Examining Why You Want More, And Solving That Issue At Its Root. At The Root Of Wanting More Is Not Being Content With What You Have. Once You’ve Learned To Be Content, You Don’t Need More. You Can Stop Acquiring, And Start Enjoying.</div><div><br></div><div>Now, I Won’t Claim To Never Want Stuff. I Wanted A Macbook Air And I Got It. It’s Helping Me To Write This Post And This Book Right Now. (However, In My Defense, I Waited More Than A Month Before Buying It To Make Sure I Needed It.) But While I Am Not Immune To Wants, I Have Learned To Catch Myself Now And Then, And To Examine Why I Want Something. And Then I Try To Tell Myself That I Already Have Everything I Could Possibly Want And Need. And That Contentedness Leads To Simplicity.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Finances</b></div><div>Really This Is The Same As Simplicity, But I Wanted To Show It From A Financial Angle. The Reason We Get Into Financial Trouble, Oftentimes, Is That We Buy More Than We Can Afford. And The Root Of That Buying Is Buying Things We Want Instead Of Only Things We Need, And The Root Of That Is Not Being Content With What We Already Have.</div><div><br></div><div>Finding Contentment With The Stuff You Have And With A Simpler Life Can Lead To Buying Less, To Buying Things We Need Instead Of Want, And To Only Spending What We Can Afford. I Know This First-hand, As Uncontrolled Spending Led To Debt For Me, And Contentedness Led To Me Getting Out Of Debt.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Relationships</b></div><div>Many Times It Seems That We’re Never Satisfied With Our Significant Others. They Don’t Behave How We Want Them To. That’s Often At The Root Of Relationship Problems, As Many-headed As Those Problems May Seem.</div><div><br></div><div>Instead, Learn To Be Content With The Person You Love, Just As They Are. This Isn’t Always Easy, As We Are Usually Trained (by Our Well-intentioned But Never-satisfied Parents, And Others Around Us) To Do Just The Opposite — To Try To Change People. However, You Will Only Find Trouble If You Try To Change Your Significant Other. You Might Get Them To Change Their Behavior (but Most Often Not), But They Will Be Unhappy, And In Turn The Relationship Will Suffer.</div><div><br></div><div>I Will Admit To Having A Problem With This At Times, But When This Happens, I Try To Remind Myself To Love My Partner As She Is, For Who She Is. She Is A Beautiful Person, Just As She Is Now, And There Is Absolutely No Need To Change Her. This Has Always Led To A Better Relationship For Me.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Kids</b></div><div>As Mentioned Above, Parents Are Often Not Satisfied With Their Children. They Need To Be Cleaner, Better Behaved, Better In School, More Organized And Studious, More Courteous And Kind And Compassionate, Better Groomed And Better At Sports. Well, That Leads To The Relationship Problems Mentioned Above, Later In The Kids’ Lives, As They Have Learned To Never Be Satisfied With Others And To Try To Change Them.</div><div><br></div><div>It Also Leads To Inferiority Complexes In Our Children, In Unhappiness, And In Bad Relationships With Them. Instead, We Should Learn To Love Our Children Unconditionally, To Accept Them For The People They Are, And To Let Them Know This Through Not Only Our Words But Our Actions.</div><div><br></div><div>Accept Children For Who They Are, And They Will Be Happier, And So Will You.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Jobs</b></div><div>Should We Be Content With Our Jobs? Well, I Won’t Say That You Should Stick With A Dead-end Job And A Boss That Treats You Like Dirt. If You’re Unhappy With Your Job, Change It. That’s Been My Approach And It’s Worked For Me.</div><div><br></div><div>However, I Have Learned That Being A Content Person In Other Areas Of My Life, And Being Content With My Life In General, Has Generally Helped Me At Any Job. Discontented People Tend To Be Complainers, Or Grumpy, Or Negative. That Leads To Problems At The Job. People Who Are Content Tend Not To Complain And Tend To Have A More Positive Attitude, And In My Experience That Almost Always Leads To More Opportunities, Both Within The Job (promotions, New Projects, Etc.) And Outside The Job (job Offers, Networking, Etc.)</div><div><br></div><div>.<b>Social Change</b></div><div>I’ve Heard Some Writers Say That People Like Me, Who Preach Happiness And Contentedness And A Positive Outlook On Life, Are Teaching People To Accept Social Injustice And Not Strive For Change. I Disagree Completely, And As Someone Who Would Like A Freer Society Than The One In Which We Currently Live, I Have Given This Much Thought.</div><div><br></div><div>My Favorite Social Disrupter, Gandhi, Had Two Seemingly Contradictory Quotes On The Subject Of Contentedness. The First: “Man’s Happiness Really Lies In Contentment.” And The Second: “Healthy Discontent Is The Prelude To Progress.</div><div><br></div><div>”This Might Seem Confusing Until You Look At How Gandhi Brought About Change. He Was Discontent With The System Of Oppression In His Country, So He Sought To Change It. However, He Was Content As A Person, With Who He Was And What He Had In His Personal Life. This Inner Content Allowed Him To Have The Inner Power To Face (and Eventually Beat) The Very Powerful Authorities In His Country At The Time. He Could Face Them Because Nothing They Could Do To Him Could Take Away His Happiness. They Could Take Away All His Possessions, Throw Him In Prison, Take Away Even Food, And He Was Content.</div><div><br></div><div>He Taught His Fellow Countrymen The Same Lesson, To Make The Best Of What They Had In India (making Their Own Simple Clothing, Making Their Own Food) Instead Of Wanting The Commercial Goods From Foreign Countries. Being Content With Such Simplicity Would Give Them The Independence From Foreign Commercial Powers, And Eventually (as They Are Part Of The Same Organism) Foreign Political Powers.</div><div><br></div><div>So Social Change Can Still Happen If You Are Content With Yourself, With Your Life, But Not Content With The System Of Oppression Around You. This System, In My Opinion, Is Responsible For Holding Us Down, For The Deaths Of Millions Of People In Third World Countries … But It Isn’t Until We Learn To Be Content With What We Have, And Free Ourselves Of Our Dependence On Commercial Goods, That We Will Be Able To Change The System For Good.</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Getting To Contentment</b></div><div>So If Contentedness Is So Great, How Do You Get There? That’s Not Always Easy, But Here Are Some Things That Have Worked For Me:</div><div><br></div><div><i><b>Count Your Blessings</b></i>. I Mentioned This Above, And In A Previous Post, But For Me It’s The Best Way To Get To Contentment. When You Find Yourself Unhappy With Something, Or With What You Don’t Have, Take A Moment To Count All The Good Things In Your Life. And I Would Bet There Are Many. It Puts The Focus On What You Do Have Rather Than What You Don’t.</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Stop, And Remind Yourself. </b>When You Find Yourself Unhappy With Someone, Or Trying To Change Them, Stop Yourself. Take A Deep Breath, And Remind Yourself That You Should Try To Be Happy With That Person For Who He/she Is. Take A Moment To Think About The Good Things About That Person, The Reasons You Love That Person. Then Accept Their Faults As Part Of Their Entire Package.</div><div><br></div><div>Stop, And Consider Why You Want Something. When You Feel The Urge To Buy Something, Think About Whether It’s A Need Or A Want. If It’s A Want, Take A Pause. It’s Good To Wait 30 Days — Keep A 30-day List … When You Want Something, Put It On The List With The Date, And If You Still Want It In 30 Days, You Can Buy It). Consider Why You Want Something. Are You Not Content With What You Already Have? Why Not?</div><div><br></div><div><b>Take Time To Appreciate Your Life!</b> I Like To Reflect On My Life, And All The Good Things In It, On A Regular Basis. I Do This When I Run, Or When I Watch The Sunset Or Sunrise, Or When I’m Out In Nature. Another Great Method Is A Morning Gratitude Session — Think Of All The Things And People You’re Thankful For, And Thank Them Silently.</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Show People You Appreciate Them. </b>It’s Good To Appreciate People, But It’s Even Better To Show Them. Give Them A Hug, Smile, Spend Time With Them, Thank Them Out Loud, Thank Them Publicly.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Breathe, And Smile.</b> Once Again, Advice From One Of My Favorite Monks, But It Works In This Context. Sometimes When We Take The Time To Breathe, And Smile, It Can Change Our Outlook On Life.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Learn To Enjoy The Simple Things</b>. Instead Of Wanting To Buy Expensive Things, And Spend Money On Doing Things Like Eating Out Or Entertainment, Learn To Enjoy Stuff That’s Free. Conversations And Walks With Other People. Spending Time Outdoors. Watching A DVD Or Playing Board Games. Going To The Beach. Playing Sports. Running. These Things Don’t Cost Much, And They Are Awesome.</div><div><br></div><div><b><i>“God’s Gifts Put Man’s Best Dreams To Shame.”&nbsp;– Elizabeth Barrett </i></b>Browning</div></div>"

		"description" : "A Few Weeks Back, I Went To See A Talk By Harvard Lecturer Tal Ben-Shahar. The Topic:&nbsp;How To Be Happy.<i><b>&nbsp;Dr. Ben-Shahar Helped Kick Off The Recent Happiness-mania That Seems To Have Infiltrated The American Zeitgeist.</b></i>&nbsp;His Positive Psychology Course At Harvard Begin As A Six-student Seminar And Expanded Over The Subsequent Few Years To Over 1400 Students — Making It, At Its Height, The University’s Most Popular Offering<div><br></div><div>What This Tells Me:&nbsp;his Advice Rings True For College Students.</div><div><br></div><div><b>From Him To Me To You</b></div><div> In The Spirit Of Last Week’s&nbsp;Radical Simplicity Manifesto, I Want To Share Dr. Ben-Shahar’s Insights. Below I Have Included His Most Interesting Points — Drawn From Both His&nbsp;lectureand His&nbsp;book.&nbsp;I Follow This Summary With Some Observations And Questions About What Would Happen If You Were To Apply This Philosophy To Your Student Life.</div><div><br></div><div>We Start With The Basics…</div><div><br></div><div><b>What Is Happiness?</b></div><div>Happiness Is The “overall Experience Of Pleasure And Meaning. A Happy Person Enjoys Positive Emotions While Perceiving Her Life As Purposeful.” The Balance Here Is Key. Neither Hedonism Nor Rat-racing Delayed Gratification Can Satisfy Alone.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Allow Yourself To Be Human</b></div><div>An Important Caveat:&nbsp;don’t Expect To Be “happy” All The Time.&nbsp;You Will Sometimes Be Sad. You Will Sometimes Be Anxious Or Nervous, You’ll Get Dumped, And You’ll Feel Overwhelmed.&nbsp;These Are Human Emotions. Don’t Fear Or Be Embarrassed Of Them.Instead, Embrace Them; They Are Part Of Life. Your Life. As Dr. Ben-Shahar Said: “<i>there&nbsp;are Some People Who Always Feel Happy, They’re Called Psychopaths.</i></div><div><i><br></i></div><div>”The Goal Should Be That&nbsp;over The Aggregate&nbsp;of Your Life You Have A Large Number Of Pleasurable Moments And Feel, On The Whole, Engaged In Meaningful Activities.</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Happiness Is The Ultimate Currency</b></div><div><br></div><div>This Is A Dangerous Thought For College Students. Increasingly, However, I’ve Been Pushing It:&nbsp;Make Happiness The Ultimate Goal In Your Life.&nbsp;Build Everything Around This; From Your Course Schedule To Your Career Path.</div><div><br></div><div>Enough Big Picture Ideas, Let’s Get To The Specific Advice…</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Tip #1: Set Goals</b></div><div><br></div><div>Research Shows That The Pursuit Of Goals That Are Concordant With Your Values Can Produce Significant Increases In Your Sense Of Well-being.&nbsp;<i><b>Interestingly, The Data Show That Achieving Goals (or Failing To Do So) Doesn’t Seem To Matter So Much</b></i>.&nbsp;There Is Something About Having A Focus On Something Important That Helps Us Get More Out Of Each Present Moment.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Tip #2: Seek Flow</b></div><div>The Magic State For Increasing Well-being Is To Be Neither Bored Nor Overwhelmed.&nbsp;This Means You Should Seek Challenges That Exactly Meet Or Slightly Surpass Your Current Abilities.&nbsp;For College Students, In Particular, This Translates To Finding That Perfect Course Load That Pushes You Intellectually Without Overwhelming You With More Work Than You Can Easily Manage.</div><div><br></div><div>T<b>ip #3: Simplify Your Life</b></div><div>Psychologist Time Kasser Has Shown That&nbsp;time Affluence&nbsp;consistently Predicts Well-beingwhereas&nbsp;material Influence&nbsp;does Not. For The Uninitiated: Time Affluence Is “the Feeling That One Has Sufficient Time To Pursue Activities That Are Personally Meaningful, To Reflect, And To Engage In Leisure.”&nbsp;In Other Words, Under-schedule What You&nbsp;have&nbsp;to Do So You Have Plenty Of Time To Deal With What You&nbsp;want&nbsp;to Do At The Moment.&nbsp;For College Students, This Means Resisting The Urge To Fill&nbsp;all&nbsp;of Your Time With Coursework And Activities. Instead, Purposefully Under-schedule, And Then Use The Excess Hours For The Cool Stuff That Randomly Pops Up.</div><div><br></div><div>Tip #4: Focus On Happiness</div><div><br></div><div>Ralph Waldo Emerson Said: “To Different Minds, The Same World Is A Hell, And A Heaven.” The Practical Translation:&nbsp;put In An Effort To Both Seek Out Happiness-boosting Experiences And Learn To Express Gratitude For What You Find.&nbsp;There Will Always Be Crap Lying Around In Your Life. This Will Never Go Away. If You Focus On It, Your World Will Become Emerson’s Hell. The Real Trick Is To Learn How To Keep Moving Amidst This Crap — Acknowledging That Its A Part Of Life That Spares No One — And Continually Seek Out Or Construct Experiences That Make You Happy.&nbsp;Don’t Just Have These Experiences, But Also Reflect On Them Later And Show Real Gratitude.&nbsp;Dr. Ben-Shahar Points To Compelling Research That Mindful Reflection On What You Enjoyed During Your Day Can Significantly Boost Self-reported Well-being.</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Case Study: The Happy College Student</b></div><div><br></div><div>Let’s Take Dr. Ben-Shahar’s Advice Out For A Spin. Here’s An Interesting Question:&nbsp;Assume You Built Your Undergraduate Life Around The Concept Of Happiness, What Would It Look Like?&nbsp;Here’s One Proposal:</div><div><br></div><div><i>Our Hypothetical Happy-focused Student Has A Single Major That He Finds Interesting.He Is Careful To Keep His Course Load Light;&nbsp;mixing Easy With Hard Courses Each Semester So He Is Never Overwhelmed With Work. By Deploying A&nbsp;smart Arsenal Of Study Habits&nbsp;he Further Reduces The Difficulty. This Allows Him To Really Dig Into The Material; Spend Extra Time Thinking About The Bigger Implications, Arguing In Class Discussions And Finding Himself Often Getting Struck, At The Most Unexpected Moments, With Little Shivers Of Inspiration. He Doesn’t Dread Schoolwork, Because He Doesn’t Have Enough Of It To Make It Painful.</i></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>He’s Involved In Some Activity That He Finds Really Important.&nbsp;</b>For Example, As A Philosophy Major, Perhaps He Believes In The Movement To Re-emphasize The Importance Of The Liberal Arts In College Education. This Might Translate, Practically, Into Him Being An Editor Of The Undergraduate Philosophy Journal And Helping To Organize The Journal’s Guest Lecture Series That Brings Interesting Liberal Thinkers Onto Campus.</div><div><br></div><div><b>However, This Is His&nbsp;only&nbsp;real Time-consuming Extracurricular Activity.</b>&nbsp;Combine This With His Manageable Course Load, And He Has Plenty Of Free Time. He Uses This For All Sorts Of Purposes. Maybe He’s Taken Up Yoga, And Has Learned To Take Advantage Of The Daily Shuttle From Campus To A Local Ski Slope. We Can Imagine That He’s Constantly Hanging Out With Friends And Has Been Known To Spend An Afternoon Reading Random Books At The Bookstore Cafe. He Attends Talks That Seem Interesting. Watches A Lot Of Movies. And Has Become A Beer Snob, To The Endless Amusement Of His Natty-lite Swilling Roommates.&nbsp;At The Same Time, These Extra Hours Also Let Him Take Advantage Of More Unexpected (and Impressive) Random Opportunities:&nbsp;like Writing An Op-ed, Pitching An Article To A Magazine, Or Volunteering To Help Setup A Conference. He’s Flexible, Engaged, And Low-stress. This Leads Him To Interesting Places.</div><div><br></div><div>This Combination Of Being Engaged In His Schoolwork, Doing Something Important, And Finding Lots Of Opportunities To Inject Some Pleasure Into His Day Leads To One Happy Undergrad.</div>"

		"title" : "10 Things Smart People Don’t Do",
		"description" : "The First Question That Merits An Answer Is What Makes An Individual Smart. Is It The Abundance Of Facts That One Can Memorize? Is It The Above Average, Or Exceptional, IQ? &nbsp;Perhaps, It Is The Wisdom To Make A Sound Decision At The Crucial Moment, Or Knowing How To Make The Best Out Of The Bad Situation.Maybe It Is The Ability To Take As Many Aspects As Possible Into Consideration Before Deciding On The Future Course Of Action. It Is Probably A Good Combination Of All The Previously Mentioned Traits.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>Of Course, If Someone Is Smart And Successful, It Is Hard To Pinpoint What Exactly Is Responsible For That Person’s Success And Well Being. Truth Be Told, It Is Far Easier To Notice What These Smart People Don’t Do, And Arrive To A Conclusion As To What Is To Be Avoided. As Long As We Circumvent These Negative Things, The Rest Will Come Naturally.</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>1. They Don’t Overlook The Possibility To Save Money</b></div><div>Prudence Is A Virtue, Not To Be Mistaken With Greed Or Stinginess. Being Able To Handle Your Finances And Save, By Avoiding Unnecessary Expenses, Is An Admirable Quality. In Fact, It Is Surprising How Many Small Details There Are, Warranting Closer Scrutiny.These Seemingly Meaningless Expenses Can Be Easily Avoided, And The Amount Of Money You Can Save Can Amount To Something Rather Significant.For Starters, Buying A Tap Filter Can Reduce The Money Spent On Bottled Water. Opting To Refill A Printer Cartridge, Rather Than Buying A New One Is Another Judicious Investment. Replacing Light Bulbs Inside Your Home With Those That Conserve Energy, Is Yet Another Wise Choice.&nbsp;Utilizing Apps To Reduce Credit Card Processing Fees, Or Choosing A Big Bank As Your Provider, Instead Of Your Local Town Bank, Is Also A Good Decision.The Internet Has An Unfathomable Amount Of Quality Content, Both Educational And Entertaining. Paying For A Cable Or Magazine Subscription Is Undeniably Meaningless. Almost Anything You Are After Can Be Found Online, At Cheaper Price, Either As A Streaming Service, Or As An Online News Article.The Point Is, Learn How To Fully Realize The Things You Are Already Paying For Or Have At Your Disposal – That’s What Being Smart Is All About.</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>2. They Don’t Heavily Rely On Others</b></div><div><br></div><div>There Is Nothing Wrong With Having Friends, Family Members Or Coworkers You Can Trust And Rely On. Everyone Should Have Someone They Can Count On When Things Go South. Heavily Relying On Someone, However, Only Portrays You As Powerless. As A Smart Individual, You Should Never Indulge Such A Commodity.You Can Have A Brilliant Mind, Outstanding Intelligence, Etc. But If You Do Not Put Those Traits To Good Use, Then You Will Only Come Off As Incompetent. When You Are In Need Of Assistance, Pay Close Attention, See If Your Problem Was Truly Difficult. In A Great Number Of Cases, It Is Our Fear And Insecurity That Prevent Us From Acting.There Is Always A Thought “What If I Only Make Things Worse?” The Thought Is Perfectly Justified. The Unwillingness To Overcome Such A Fear On The Other Hand, Isn’t.</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>3. They Don’t Act Irresponsibly</b></div><div>Do Not Mistake This Statement As “Smart People Don’t Have Fun” Or “Smart People Are Boring.” You Can Have Fun, You Can Have A Drink, Or Have A Good Laugh. Irresponsibility Does Not Equal Uninteresting, It Only Means You Like To Have An Organized Lifestyle.Superior Organization Leads To Greater Efficiency, Whether You Are A Student, An Employee, A Business Owner, An Artist, Or A Celebrity.We All Have Certain Responsibilities, And They Are Not Always Imposed By Someone Else. Putting Them Off For No Valid Reason Is Simply Packing To Travel Into A More Stressful Future. Almost Everyone Experiences How Being Irresponsible Tends To Backfire, But Smart People Simply Practice What They Learn From Such Inconveniences.</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>4. They Don’t Feel Defeated Just Because They Need To Reevaluate Their Convictions</b></div><div>Our Environment, Our Parents, Our Education And Our Past Are All Responsible For Forging Our Convictions And Our Perception Of The World. It Leads To A Creation Of What Is Referred To As “umwelt” Which Roughly Translates As “self-centered World”.&nbsp;Umwelt Is More Connected To How We Create The Image Of The World Surrounding Us&nbsp;by Using Our Sense, But It Can Be Extended To Our Point Of View On Philosophical Matters.The Convictions We Acquire Throughout Life Are Not Wrong Per Se, But Are Very Likely To Be Proven Incompatible When Exposed To An Entirely New Experience Or More Difficult Questions That Need Answering. Also, If You Move Out And Change The Environment You Are Likely To Witness Different Patterns Of Behavior, Simply Because Education, Or Lack Of Education In Some Areas, Resulted In The Blooming Of Other Other Human Qualities.Sooner Or Later, Our Convictions Are Challenged And Sometimes They Will Triumph, Sometimes They Will Be Trumped. Smart People Constantly Challenge Their Convictions; They Do Not Discard Them. They Reshape Them, And They Allow Them To Grow Proportionally With Their New Experience. Don’t Miss Out On The Opportunity To Broaden Your Mind-set, You Are Not Defeated If You Gained Something Valuable.</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>5. They Don’t Dwell On Their Errors</b></div><div>To Clarify, This Refers To Companies That Manufactured A Bad Product, Or Movie Directors Who Made Bad Movies, Etc. It Is Not Uncommon To Come Up With An Idea For Something That Appears Like A True Masterwork For Us, But Once It’s Realized, The General Public May Not Be That Impressed. It Can Feel Humiliating And Really Unpleasant, However It Happens, Whether We Like It Or Not.When You Are Making Something Intended To Be Appealing To The Masses, And In The End Fail, Start Over Again From Scratch. If You Want To Impress, Listen To Your Audience, Don’t Try To Patch Up The Product, Or Make Sequels, In An Attempt To Prove Your Vision Was Brilliant.This Kind Of Behavior Will Only Cost You Your Credibility, And Even When You Manage To Come Up With Something Good, People Might Not Even Bother To Give It A Try. It Won’t Make You Neither Weak Nor Foolish, If You Know When To Give Up. It Will Only Give You More Time To Work On Your Comeback.</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>6. They Don’t Permit Their Past To Hold Them Back</b></div><div>The Past Cannot Be Erased, And It Does Not Come Back To Haunt Us, It Simply Never Leaves. We Need To Learn How To Cope With It, And Not Allow It To Interfere With Our Future Achievements. If There Is Nothing Useful To Be Recovered From The Past Experience, Simply Close Those Doors And Let It Go.Past Experiences Shape Who We Are Today, And Our Previous Struggles Can Build A Strong Character, But People Tend To Use Their Past To Justify Their Mistakes Or Behaviour. Perhaps We Use These Excuses To Gain Understanding From Others, Or To Make It Easier To Forgive Ourselves.Still, If You Acknowledge Your Flaws But Refuse To Do Something About Them Just Because You Have An Excuse, Then You Have Chosen An Easy Way Out, And That’s Not What Smart People Do.</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>7. They Don’t Rely On Good Luck To Solve Their Problems</b></div><div>“Hope For The Best But Be Prepared For The Worst.” A Good Quote To Be Guided By When You Invest Your Time And Efforts Into Something. Hope For The Best Possible Scenario Is What Motivates Us, Whereas Preparing For The Worst Prevents Us From Falling Apart. On The Other Hand, Simply Hoping For The Things To Work Themselves Out Is No Different From Being Lazy.Luck Should Only Take Credit For A Fragment Of Your Success, Considering That Relying On It Too Frequently Will Only Suffocate Your Ambition.Besides, Smart People Would Never Permit Luck To Take Glory For All Their Hard Work. When You Pour Your Heart And Soul Into Achieving Your Goal, It Would Be Disappointing To Give Good Fortune The Title Of “major Contributor”</div><div><br></div><div>.<b>8. They Don’t Neglect Important Aspects Of Their Business&nbsp;</b></div><div>One Of The Key Factors Responsible For Success Is Attention To Details Or Just Paying Good Attention In General. When One Is Trying To Be A Smart Business Owner, He Or She Is Generally Governed By The Idea That With A Quality Product, Success Is Guaranteed.The Logic Is Not Entirely Flawless, Since Even If You Can Offer A Top Quality Product At A Better Price Than Your Competition, You Are Still A Far Cry From A Lucrative Business.The Absolute Necessity For A Successful Selling Period Is Credibility, Meaning You Will Need To Have A Good Advertising Tactic. This Implies Striving Towards Omnipresence And Professional Appearance, Which Brings Us To The Most Efficient Tool For Spreading This Kind Of Brand Awareness, And That Is Your Website.The Impact Of The Website Should Never Be Underestimated; People Will Judge You As A Professional Based On Your Website Design, Its Responsiveness, Authority And Its Content. There Are Numerous People Who Offer An Amazing Type Of Service Or Products, In Person, But Simply Look Like Amateurs Online.Start Off By Finding&nbsp;a Good Web Hosting Service, To Ensure Your Sites Responsiveness, Proceed With Quality Design, And Finally, Eloquently Describe Your Product Or Service.Clearly, This Is A Single Example Of An Important Aspect, There Are Others As Well. Like Providing A Good Customer Service And Creating Efficient Incentive Plans Etc. But The Point Is Never To Push In One Direction. Always Work On Numerous Fronts.</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>9. They Don’t Hesitate To Learn From Their Mistakes</b></div><div>Mistakes Are Inevitable. Sooner Or Later Something Goes Wrong, And An Unaccounted For Variable Emerges, And Places A Grave Dent In Our Previously Well-laid Schemes. You Can’t Always Have Everything Under Your Control, And We Do Not Have The Degree Of Awareness Necessary To View Every Possible Angle.Mistakes Are There To Remind Us Of Our Flaws, And Force Us To Mitigate The Impact They Have On Our Lives. Honestly,&nbsp;mistakes Can Teach Us A Lot About Our Lives, And Ourselves, But Only If We Let Them.Learning From Your Mistakes Means Finding What Is Worth Salvaging From Your Unfortunate Experience, Realizing What Went Wrong And Finding A Way To Avert It In The Future. Smart People Use This Input To Work On Themselves, And Change The Things They Have The Power To Change.Arrogant People Look For Excuses, And Choose To Blindly Believe In Their Judgement Without Any Retrospect. Not Only Does This Kind Of Behaviour Hinder Your Future Success, It Also Drives People, And Allies, Away From You.</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>10. They Don’t Give Up On Their Ideas Just Because Other People Don’t Agree With Them</b></div><div>I Know That It Was Stated How Knowing When To Give Up And Start Anew Is A Good Thing, And How Being Too Stubborn Or Pushy Will Ultimately Yield Bad Results. Well, A Wise Person Knows When He Or She Should Push The Envelope And Stand Firm When The Situation Takes A Turn For The Worst.There Is A Difference Between When Someone Gives Your Idea A Chance And Did Not Like It In The End And Someone Not Giving Your Idea A Chance At All. We Are All Entitled To Constructive Feedback On Why Our Ideas Or Products Are Not Satisfactory.If Someone Wants To Discard Our Efforts Based On A Hunch, Do Not Let Them. Fight For Your Chance To Shine, Or Try Finding Someone Else Who Will Hear You Out And Appreciate Your Idea.There Is Always A Possibility That Someone Is Intimidated By Your Expertise; Thus That Person Wants To Hinder Your Development. If You Want To Publish Or Launch Something, Look For More Than One Opinion. Even If The First One Is Flattering, Look For More.Constructive Criticism Can Be Used As A Precious Insight For The Future.&nbsp;</div>"

		"description" : "It Happens To All Of Us, Whether We Bring It On Our Selves Or It Just&nbsp;shows Up. That Pit In Your Stomach. The Butterflies. The Times When Our Palms Start To Sweat. I’m Talking About When We Are Thinking About Things We Don’t Want To Do — The Things That We Know We&nbsp;should&nbsp;do&nbsp;in Order To Get To Where We Want To Go. I Know You Know What I’m Talking About And I Guarantee You Have At Least One Thing In Your Mind You Are Thinking About Right Now.<div><br></div><div>You Might Be Thinking Of That Dream Or Big Goal That You Want To Accomplish One Day. The Book You Want To Write. The Business You Want To Start. The Big Audacious Goal That Scares The Daylights Out Of You But Keeps You Dreaming Because You Know You Can Do It. The Problem Is That There Are A Lot Of Steps Along The Way That Are Uncomfortable. It Can Be As Small As That Email You Don’t Want To Send Or That Person You Don’t Want To Call, Even Though You Know At The End Of The Day It Will Make You Better And That Much Closer To Your Goal.</div><div><br></div><div>Here Is A List Of Eight Of Those Uncomfortable Things, Though The List Could Go On And On. Let’s Be Honest: We All Procrastinate. How Do You Overcome&nbsp;procrastination? You Make Things Easier To Do.It’s Not Rocket Science. When You Do Uncomfortable Things More Often, They Become More Comfortable. Maybe After Doing These Things More Often, You’ll Lose That Pit In Your Stomach The Next Time It’s Your Turn To Show Up.</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>1. Waking Up Early</b></div><div>We Know We Should Do It And That It Will Make&nbsp;us Feel Great For The Rest Of The Day. We Feel Energized And Ready For The Day The One Time A Month We Finally Do It. So, Why Do We Not Do This Every Day? I’ll Tell You Why I Don’t: Because My Bed Is So Warm And Comfy! When My Alarm Wakes Me Up Early And I Know I Can Either A) Get Up And Spend Some Time For Myself Before The Day Gets Started, Or B) Spend Another Hour Or Two Getting Some More Z’s, I’ll Pick The Snooze Button Almost Every Time. We’ve All Heard The Interviews With The Most Successful People Telling Us About Their Early Morning Routines. How They Read, Work Out, Make A Healthy And Organic Breakfast, And Then Still Have Time To Journal All Before Work. It’s Pretty Hard To Believe They’ve Ever&nbsp;heard&nbsp;of A Snooze Button.One Thing That I Started Recently To Help Me Wake Up A Little Earlier Is The Five Minute Journal. It Has Been A Great First Step In Waking Up Earlier Than Normal. The Best Part Is, It’s Only Five Minutes Earlier Than I Would Usually Get Up!</div><div><br></div><div><b>2. Public Speaking</b> Talk About A Pit In Your Stomach! The Only People You Meet That Love Public Speaking Are Public Speakers! They Do It All The Time And Likely Get Paid To Do It. You Can’t Be Successful Without Someone Giving You A Stage To Tell Your Story. You Can Try To Avoid It All You Want, But It Comes With The Territory.People Striving For Success (like You And Me) Want To Know How Successful People Got To Where They Are. How Do You Think They Tell Their Story To Us?Public Speaking, Like Everything Else On This List, Is Something We Need To Start Doing To Make It More Comfortable. Whether It’s Volunteering For A Toast, Starting A Video Blog, Or Chiming In When The Speaker Says “does Anyone Have Any Questions?”. That’s Our&nbsp;turn To Push Through The Discomfort!</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>3. Exercising</b></div><div>You Might Be Saying “Hey, I Exercise All The Time And I’m Still Not Successful.” Maybe You’re Not, But You Are One Step Ahead Of Most&nbsp;of Us! For Those Of You, Like Me, Who Break A Sweat Twice A Week Every 30 Days (aka 2 Times A Month), Exercising Isn’t On The List Of Top To-dos. Maybe You Just Can’t Seem To Find The Time. It’s Time To Make The Time.I Wish They Would Come Out With A Study That Shows That Getting That Extra Hour Of Sleep Before Work Or The Extra Episode On Netflix Before Bed Gives You More Energy And Is Better For Your Body Than Exercising, But I Still Haven’t Seen It. Instead, I Keep Seeing Studies Like This One From Harvard That Reads&nbsp;“Regular Exercise Changes The Brain To Improve Memory, Thinking Skills,”&nbsp;and Just Hoping They Misplaced&nbsp;“exercise” When It Should’ve Said&nbsp;“doughnuts.” Still Waiting On That Study.</div><div><br></div><div><b>4. Networking</b></div><div>You Just Received&nbsp;an Email In Your Inbox That Reads, “The Local&nbsp;business Professional Networking Group Will Be At The Office From 5:00 To 5:30 Today, Please Stay Late&nbsp;to Network With Them.” This Just Makes You Jump For Joy, Right? Not Even Close! You Know You Should, And You Might Meet An Awesome Connection To Help You With Your Next Goal Or Job, But Your Soft, Warm Couch Is Calling Your Name In A Calming, Late-night Radio Voice That You Can’t Resist.I Give The Excuse Of “I Am Terrible At Small Talk And I Could Care Less About Meaningless Conversation.” It’s A Valid Excuse And My Go-to Every Time. It Doesn’t Get Me Anymore Connections And I Never Meet Anyone Exciting Or New Because Of It. Let’s Start Small And Start Asking Questions.The People That Are The Most Charismatic And Outgoing Ask The Most Questions. Have You Ever Noticed That? You Don’t Need To Make Small Talk. Ask Questions And Let The Other Person Talk. The Truth Is That The More People Talk, The More They Like You. Strange, But True.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><b>5. Taking The Blame</b></div><div>This Point Does Not Read “taking The Blame For Someone Else.” This Is About Admitting Your Own Mistakes When You Mess Up. It’s So Easy And Comfortable To Quickly Make Excuses For When You Mess Up. When A Mistake Is Made And No One Takes The Blame, It’s Hard To Move Forward And Get It Fixed Because No One Wants To Fix Someone Else’s Mistake If They Won’t Fess Up.This One Is So Simple, But It’s Not Our First Reaction. Leaders Take Responsibility. When They Or Their Team Mess Up, They Take It On The Cheek. The Best Part About This Very Uncomfortable Action Is That It Helps Everyone Quickly Move On. You Can’t Move Forward Unless You Start To Look In That Direction. Take The Blame And Take The Next Step Forward.</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>6. Continuously Learning</b></div><div>You Know Your Dream&nbsp;and&nbsp;your Goals. Are You Reading The Right Books To Reach Those Goals? Are You Attending Seminars And Conferences In That Genre?I Was Very Guilty Of This For A Long Time.&nbsp;I Was Reading Books That I Wanted To Read, Books That Were Comfortable. Of Course, Reading Is A Great Hobby. If You Are A Reader, Don’t Stop. If You Are Not, Start!The Uncomfortable Part Is Reading Books That You Know Will Get You Closer To Your Dream Or Goal, But Are Not On The Top Of Your Reading List. Don’t Just Read For Joy, Read To Build Your Knowledge.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>7. Unplugging</b>&nbsp;</div><div>If The Leader Of The Smartphone Revolution Didn’t Let His Kids Use His Own Inventions, There Must Be A Benefit. There Are More Smartphones Than Humans On This Planet Now. We Are Even Starting To Wear These Devices On Our Wrists Because It’s Too Difficult To Reach Into Our Pockets To Read Texts! We Are All Guilty Of The Smartphone And Other Technologies Ruling Our Lives.</div><div><br></div><div>If You Want To Be Successful, Do As The Successful Do. Who Doesn’t Want To Have The Success Steve Jobs Had?&nbsp;He Limited The Time His Kids Spent With Technology Because He Knew It Would Slow Them Down In The Long Run.&nbsp;As Much As We Like To Think Our IPhones Keep Us More Connected And More Efficient, They Don’t. We Could Get A Lot More Done In A Day If We Weren’t Checking Out What Our Friends Are Eating, Where They Are In The World, Or Perfecting Our Next Post To Make Them Just As Jealous.You Know Exactly What I’m Talking About — We Are All Guilty. Let’s Get Uncomfortable And Start Unplugging At The Times We Want To Plug In The Most!</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>8. Meeting Adversity On Purpose</b></div><div>Who Is Ready To Face The&nbsp;most Difficult And Most Uncomfortable Thing They Can Think Of And Jump Headfirst In? Adversity Is More Simply Defined As “Difficulty.” I’m Not Talking About Feeling Good When You Start Off Your Day With A Spilled Latte. That Stinks, But I’m Talking About Getting In Over Your Head, Taking On Something That You Know You Can’t Accomplish Right Away, But That You Believe In Yourself Enough To Try And Make It Happen.The Great Philosopher John Wayne Said It Best, “Courage Is Being Scared To Death… And Saddling Up Anyway.”There Is A Quick Story In The Bible That I Love About A Man Named <i>Benaiah:Benaiah</i> The Son Of <i>Jehoiada</i>, Mighty In Deeds, Struck Down The Two Sons Of Ariel Of<i> Moab</i>. He Also Went Down And Killed A Lion Inside A Pit On A Snowy Day.He Went Face To Face With A Lion And Killed It. Not With A Gun In Perfect Weather, But On A Snowy Day With&nbsp;some Sort Of Ancient Weapon— He Faced A Deadly Predator And Conquered It.What Gives You A&nbsp;pit In Your Stomach That You Know Will Make You A Better Person, A Better Parent, A Better Boss, A Better Employee, Or Will Help You Reach Your Big Audacious Goals? If It’s Uncomfortable, It’s Probably Something We Know We&nbsp;should Start Doing.</div>"

But You Should Know That The Preparation Instructions Are Just As Important As The Formula Itself. Unlike Traditional Tea Infusions, Essiac Tea Is A Decoction, Meaning It Involves Extracting The Essence Of The Roots, Bark, And Seeds Of Plant Material, Which Includes Things Like Mineral Salts, Bitter Principles, And Other “hard” Materials That Require Boiling And Extensive Steeping To Extract.See Details About My Book,&nbsp;The Truth About Cancer&nbsp;and FREE Exclusive Bonuseshere.</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>2. Hoxsey Tonic</b></div><div>Hoxsey Tonic Is A Lot Like Essiac Tea In Its Purpose And Functionality. The Basic Solution Includes The Following Two Ingredients: Cascara Sagrada (Rhamnus Purshiana) Bark Powder And Potassium Iodide, An Essential Mineral That’s Widely Regarded For Supplying The Body With Necessary Iodine, Which Helps Support Thyroid Health, Balance Hormones (which Is Essential For Preventing Cancer!), And Mitigate Radioactive Damage. There Are Also 7 Or 8 Important Herbs Which Combine To Make The Hoxsey Tonic Protocol So Successful.Some Components Of The Tea Are Also Known To Potentially Deplete Potassium Levels, Which Is Why It’s Important To Consult With A Qualified Physician Who Can Monitor Your Nutrient Levels And Help Keep You Balanced During And After Treatment.</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>3. Cannabis (Hemp)</b></div><div>Considered By Many To Be One Of The Most Versatile Healing Plants In The World, Cannabis Sativa, Which Also Goes By Names Like Hemp, Marijuana, And “weed” Depending On How It’s Used, Is Gaining A Lot Of Attention These Days On The Cancer Treatment Front. Reports Of People Juicing Cannabis Leaves And Eating High-potency Cannabis Oil To Cure Chronic Diseases Like Cancer Are Everywhere, And You Might Be Surprised To Know That Such Medical Uses Are Definitively Backed By Science.Though It’s Been On The Record Since At Least The 1970s That Cannabis Targets And Destroys Cancer Cells, The U.S. Government Officially Regards The Plant As Being Medically Useless, Which Is Why It’s Still “illegal” At The Federal Level. Because Of This Longstanding Policy Of Prohibition, Research Into The Therapeutic Potential Of Cannabis Remains Limited, Though There’s Enough Of It To Suggest That Serious Reform Is Needed, And Now.Cannabis Has Been Used As Medicine Throughout The World For Thousands Of Years. Only Within The Last 100 Years Was Its Reputation Tarnished By Special Interest Groups. &nbsp;Now That The Cat’s Out Of The Bag And People Are Learning That Cannabis Isn’t The Harmful Vice Or “devil’s Weed” That The Drug Warriors Have Long Claimed It Is, We’re Seeing A Resurgence Of Interest Into Its Therapeutic Use, Particularly As A Treatment And Cure For Cancer.Hemp Is Densely Packed With Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Clean Protein, And Other Vital Nutrients. Hemp Oil Also Contains Up To 5 Percent Pure Gamma Linolenic Acid, The Highest Concentration Among All Known Plants.Therapeutic Cannabis, Which Includes The Kind People Smoke, Contains Much Higher Levels Of An Anticancer Substance Known As Tetrahydrocannabinol, Or THC. THC Often Gets A Bad Rap As The “high”-producing Chemical That Supposedly Makes People Lazy While Encouraging Addiction. But THC Is In Fact A Proven Anticancer Substance With Tremendous Potential To Make Chemotherapy And Radiation Obsolete. Dozens Of Scientific Papers Have Shown That THC Causes Cancer Cells To Commit Suicide. This Has Been Seen In Cancers Of The Brain, Lung, Bile Duct, Skin, Blood, And Many Others.Cannabis Is A Therapeutic Powerhouse, And The Sooner It’s Removed From Schedule I Status And Its Prohibition Is Lifted, The Better Off The General Population Will Be, Healthwise.</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>4. Detoxification</b></div><div>The Body Has Its Own Detoxifying Mechanisms Such As The Lymph Nodes, Liver, And Kidneys, Of Course, But These Organs Can Become Overburdened Depending On Your Level Of Toxic Exposure. If More Toxins Are Coming In Than Are Being Flushed Out—which Is Pretty Common In Today’s Polluted World—the End Result Is Decreased Oxygen Delivery To Cells, A Sluggish Colon, And Heightened Vulnerability To Bacteria, Viruses, Fungi, And Parasites: Not Exactly The Place You Want To Be.</div><div><br></div><div>It Is Important To Detoxify In The Proper&nbsp;order. Many Medical Doc­tors And Health Practitioners Agree That A Proper Cleansing Regimen Is Sequenced Like This:</div><div><br></div><div><i><b>Colon Cleanse</b></i></div><div><i><b>Parasite Cleanse</b></i></div><div><i><b>Kidney Cleanse</b></i></div><div><i><b>Live/Gallbladder Cleanse</b></i></div><div><i><b>Blood Cleanse</b></i></div><div>When Initiating Any Detoxification Protocol, Be Aware That Your Body Will Be Going Through Immense Changes That May Provoke Various Elimination And “die-off” Symptoms. These May Include Headaches, Fever, Upset Stomach, Diarrhea, Skin Breakouts, And Other Uncomfortable But Common Side Effects.</div><div><br></div><div><b>5. Gerson Therapy</b></div><div>Any Detoxification Protocol Is Only As Effective As Its Conjunctive Nutrition Protocol. The Gerson Therapy Is A Great Example Of This Philosophy, Combining The Power Of Aggressive Cleansing With High-density Nourishment To Maximize The Body’s Intrinsic Ability To Heal Itself Of Chronic Disease.</div><div><br></div><div>It’s An All-encompassing Body Replenishment Protocol That Addresses The Two Primary Causes Of Degenerative Disease—toxicity And Nutrient Deficiency—hence Its Incredible, Nonspecific Ability To Tackle A Vast Array Of Health Issues.The Gerson Therapy Also Utilizes Intensive Detoxification To Eliminate Waste Buildup, Regenerate The Liver (your Body’s Main Detoxifier), Boost The Immune System, And Restore The Three Key Systems That Make Up The Body’s Natural Defense Arsenal—the Enzyme, Mineral, And Hormonal Systems: “With Generous, High-quality Nutrition, Increased Oxygen Availability, Detoxification, And Improved Metabolism, The Cells—and The Body—can Regenerate, Become Healthy And Prevent Future Illness.”There Are Currently Two Inpatient Facilities Where Patients Can Receive Gerson Therapy Under The Guidance And Supervision Of A Qualified Physician And Trained Staff: The Gerson Clinic In Tijuana, Mexico, And The Gerson Health Centre In Budapest, Hungary.The Gerson Institute&nbsp;has Also Provided Free Information Online For Individuals Looking To Administer The Gerson Therapy At Home With The Help Of Friends And Family Members.</div><div><br></div><div><b>6. Diet</b></div><div>There Are As Many Dietary Protocols For Cancer As There Are Stars In The Sky, It Seems. But I’d Like To Focus On The Foundational Principles That Weave A Common Thread Through All Of Them.Everything You Put In Your Body Either Fuels Cancer Or Deters It.Cancer-fueling Foods Are Those That Lower PH And Are Nutritionally Deficient, Tainted With Toxins, And Conducive To Cancer Cell Growth. These Include Things Like Refined Sugar, Processed Flour, Trans Fats, MSG, Nitrites, Aspartame, Conventional Products, And Really Anything That’s Been Highly Processed And Has A Long List Of Ingredients; Such Foods Are Typically Found On Shelves In The Inner Aisles Of The Grocery Store.Cancer-fighting Foods Are Those That Help Balance PH And Kill Cancer Cells, And Nearly All Of Them Are Dense In Vitamins, Minerals, And Enzymes, Which I Covered Earlier. These Include Things Like Organic Produce, Grass-fed And Pasture-raised Meats And Dairy Products, Cruciferous Vegetables (broccoli, Cauliflower, And Brussel Sprouts), Nuts And Seeds, Saturated Fats, Herbs, And Clean, Mineral-rich Water.</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>7. Energy Medicine</b></div><div>The<i><b>&nbsp;Hope4Cancer</b></i> <i><b>Institute&nbsp;</b></i>in <i><b>Baja</b></i> California, Mexico Is One Clinic That Successfully Uses Energy Medicine To Cure Cancer. In A Nutshell, A Special Sensitizing Agent Is Administered To Cancer Patients, And This Agent Acts As A Type Of Trojan Horse To Gain Entry Into Cancer Cells. Once Inside, This Agent Awaits Its “orders” From Either Light Or Sound, Or Both, To Release An Oxygen Molecule That Effectively Kills The Cell On Contact.</div><div><br></div><div>This Sensitizer, Has An Almost Universal Propensity For Malignant Cells, With Only A Very Small Number Of Healthy Cells Getting Caught In The Fray. And Those Few Healthy Cells That Absorb The Sensitizer Spit It Out Within A Day Or Two. Since The Sensitizer Is Naturally Occurring And Completely Nontoxic (the Chlorophyll Derivative Of Seaweed), Patients Can Rest Assured That They Aren’t Being Systematically Poisoned With A Toxic Chemical In The Process Of Being Treated For Their Cancers.</div><div><br></div><div>8<b>. Heat</b></div><div>And Last But Not Least In The Healing Energy Category: The Heat Factor. You’re Probably Already Familiar With What Happens When You Contract A Serious Illness And Your Body Goes Into Hyperdrive By Reacting With A Fever, Or High Temperature. This Hyperthermic Response Is The Body’s Way Of Naturally Fighting The Infection, And Contrary To Popular Belief, It Shouldn’t Be Minimized With Ibuprofen And Other Drugs Because It’s A Good Thing, Despite Being Uncomfortable.</div><div><br></div><div>As It Turns Out, Hyperthermia Is Also Beneficial In The Treatment Of Cancer. In 1893, Dr. William B. Coley Discovered How The Body’s Hyperthermic Response To Bacteria Can Also Help Kill Cancer Cells. He Purposely Injected Bacterial Toxins Into The Tumors Of 10 Cancer Patients And Watched As Their Bodies Responded With Fevers, Effectively Killing The Tumors.</div><div><br></div><div>Hyperthermia Is A Highly Effective Way To Kill Cancer Cells. They Only Need To Be Heated To About 108 Degrees Fahrenheit For Roughly One Hour In Order To Die. Healthy Cells, On The Other Hand, Die At A Much Higher Temperature, So This Heating Process Is Completely Safe And 100 Percent Selective, Destroying Only Malignant Cells.</div><div><br></div><div>Heat Is Beneficial To Health, Helping To Destroy Pathogens And Even Cancer Cells While Preserving Friendly Microflora And Healthy Cells. Both External Heat (infrared Saunas) And Internal Heat (hot Peppers) Confer Health Benefits When Applied Properly.</div><div><br></div><div>For More Alternative Treatment Therapies, See My Book,&nbsp;The Truth About Cancer,where I Explain Several Other Therapies Not Covered In This Article Including:</div><div><br></div><div><i><b>Pulsed Electromagnetic Fields</b></i></div><div><i><b>High-radio-frequency Generators</b></i></div><div><i><b>Molecular Resonance Effect Technology</b></i></div><div><i><b>Bio-oxidative Therapies</b></i></div><div><i><b>Vitamin C Injections</b></i></div><div><i><b>UV Blood Irradiation</b></i></div><div><i><b>Virotherapeutics</b></i></div><div><i><b>Essential Oils</b></i></div><div>I Trust That I Have Made It Abundantly Clear That There Are Many Natural Alternatives To The “Big Three”—chemotherapy, Radiation, And Surgery—although The Alternatives May Not Have The Stamp Of Approval Of The Cancer Industry. Hopefully, You Now Realize You Do Not Have To Poison, Slash, Or Burn Your Body.</div>"

You Would Be In Different “places,” Figuratively Speaking.</div><div><br></div><div>In My Book,&nbsp;<b>Uncharted,</b>&nbsp;I Have 2 Exercises To Do Which Can Take Your Mind Away From The Intense Pain You Are Experiencing In That Moment By Shifting Your Perspective Of The Situation.</div><div><br></div><div>The&nbsp;Awakening The Observing Self&nbsp;exercise Uses My&nbsp;Invision Process&nbsp;to Help You Step Back From Your Emotional Reality, Observe It As A Landscape, And Identify Its Features. Awakening Your Observing Abilities Allows You To Not Feel So Immersed In The Experience That You Identify With It And Can’t See Any Way Out Of It.</div><div><br></div><div>So Let’s Go To The Realm Of Spirit And Wake Up That&nbsp;Observing Self.&nbsp;Just As With Any Of The&nbsp;Invision&nbsp;Process&nbsp;exercises In My Book,&nbsp;Uncharted, Find A Quiet, Private Place To Do This Exercise, And Have Your Journal Or Pen And Paper Handy.</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Exercise 1: Awakening The Observing Self</b></div><div><b><i><br></i></b></div><div><i>Sit Comfortably And Close Your Eyes.</i></div><div><br></div><div>Tune Into Your Current State Of Mind. Without Any Judgment Of Yourself—without Trying To Figure Out What You Should Be Feeling Or Thinking—just Describe Your State Of Mind In Three Adjectives (for Example,&nbsp;happy, Mellow, Tired&nbsp;or&nbsp;angry, Fearful, Blaming).</div><div><br></div><div>Now, Ask Yourself, “Where Am I?”</div><div><br></div><div>Let A Landscape Comes Up In Your Mind’s Eye And Simply Observe It. You Might See A Meadow Filled With Poppies And Chirping Birds—or, Conversely, A Volcano Beside A Burned Down Forest.</div><div><br></div><div>Then Open Your Eyes And Write Down A Description Of The Place You Saw Or Sensed. You Might Have Seen It Vividly, Or If You’re Less Visual, You Might Have Gotten An Instant Knowing That The Place Would Have Certain Characteristics.</div><div><br></div><div>Let Your Imagination Wander And Deliver You Images Or Information That You Just Somehow “know.” Don’t Try To Force Anything. This Process Requires Your Unconscious To Be Actively Engaged In Showing You Symbols And Images, And When You Relax, It Will.</div><div><br></div><div>Close Your Eyes Again And Allow The Place To Come Up Again In Your Awareness.Now That You’re Looking At The Place Rather Than Being Focused On Your Feelings, Pay Attention To How Your Attention Is Shifting. Notice What Is Changing.</div><div><br></div><div>Then Ask Yourself, “Who Is The One Looking At This Place?”</div><div><br></div><div>Tune Your Attention To The One Who Is Looking—your Observing Self.</div><div><br></div><div>How Does This Self Feel Different From The Self That Sat Down At The Beginning Of This Exercise?</div><div><br></div><div>What Words Or Images Come To Mind To Describe The Difference?</div><div><br></div><div>Open Your Eyes And Write About What You Just Observed.The Small Self Can Be Thought Of As The Younger Self, Brash And A Bit Of A Know-it-all, While The Observing Self Is The Older And Wiser Witness, More Philosophical And Detached And Less Reactive To Outer Circumstances. Remember, The Observing Self Is Your Soul Self, Which Is Immortal And Directly Connected To Source Or Spirit.</div><div><br></div><div>This Observing Self Makes No Judgments; It Enables You To Be Discerning, Seeing The Qualities Of Something Without Creating Emotions Or A Story About It. The Small Self Assigns Meaning According To Memory, Which Is Always Colored By Our Emotional Perception.</div><div><br></div><div>The Soul Self Just Observes “cat Bite,” And Doesn’t Care If Cat Bites Or Doesn’t Bite. It Wants To Have A Full Experience. It Observes, And It Experiences All Aspects Of The Human Condition. By Working Through Us, It Makes Possible The Art We Make Of Our Human Life.I Teach Everyone I Train In The Invision Process My Favorite Thing To Say When Accessing The Observing Self: “That’s Interesting.”Now That You Have Experienced The Observing Self, You Can Awaken It Again To Bring Yourself Home To The Realm Of Spirit, A Sanctuary You Can Visit At Any Time, Using The Following Exercise That Picks Up Where The Previous Exercise Left Off</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>.Exercise 2: At Home In The Realm Of Spirit</b></div><div><br></div><div>When You Feel At Home In Your Skin, Safe And Secure, You Are In The Realm Of Spirit. Pick A Time When You Are Feeling Relaxed; Then Sit Comfortably, Close Your Eyes, And Focus On Your Breathing Until You Feel Even More Relaxed. Choose To Create A Feeling Of Security And Safety Within Yourself. Then Ask Yourself, “Where Am I?”</div><div><br></div><div>What Image Or Idea Of A Landscape Comes Into Your Mind?</div><div><br></div><div>Pay Attention To The Qualities Of The Place You See. What Is It—a Temple? An Open Field? A Beach? Is There A Breeze? What Does It Feel Like Against Your Skin? Is There Greenery—grass, Bushes, Trees, Flowers? What Is The Quality Of The Light?</div><div><br></div><div>Bring Your Attention Now To Being In The Position Of Observing Self. You Should Immediately Begin To Sense A Calm, Mindful Detachment As You Witness The Place From A Distance—pull Back From It, Like A Camera Backing Away From The Scene.</div><div><br></div><div>As You Pull Away From Identifying With The Place And The Feelings You Are Experiencing In This Landscape, Imagine That You See This Place Is Sitting In The Hands Of Spirit, Whose Giant Hands Are Made Up Of Sparkling Light Energy And Unconditional Love. Pause There For A Moment, Enjoying The Beauty And The Grace.</div><div><br></div><div>Now Allow Yourself To Move Back Into The Landscape And Relax Into This Unique Sanctuary.

They Deserve Answers.&nbsp;They At Least Deserve Being Asked. Yet Are Great Numbers Of People Asking Them? Are Politicians? No. Presidents And Prime Ministers, Kings And Heads Of State? No. Religious Figures? No. Educators? Not Many. Military Generals And Admirals? No. Leaders Of Business And Industry? No. Ordinary People At Their Dinner Table? Well, Yes, Possibly. Beginning Now.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Perhaps. Beginning Now.Ordinary People Like You And I Will Now Be Asking These Questions All Over The Planet. And When We Finish Asking The First Three, We’ll Then Move To...</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Four Fundamental Questions Of Life</b></div><div><br></div><div><i>1.&nbsp;Who Am I?</i></div><div><i>2.&nbsp;Where Am I?</i></div><div><i>3.&nbsp;Why Am I Where I Am?</i></div><div><i>4.&nbsp;What Do I Intend To Do About That?</i></div><div>I Do Not Believe That One Can Ignore These Questions And Rapidly Evolve. None Of Us Can. We Must End Any Personal Confusion We May Have Around These Questions (there Are Many Other Questions In Life, But These Are Foundational), Or We Will Go Through Our Days And Nights Having No Idea What We’re Doing Or Why We’re Doing It.</div><div><br></div><div>This Is The Situation With Most People On The Earth Today. And That Is The Reason Why The World Is In The Condition That It’s In.I Did Not Move Forward In My Life Until I Answered The Four Fundamental Questions Of Life. (And By The Way, I Answer Them Daily.&nbsp;Sometimes&nbsp;during&nbsp;the Day As Events Transpire. Used In This Way, These Questions Are Not Only Informative, They Are&nbsp;transformative.)&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>And The First Of These Four Is The Real Key. It Unlocks Everything. It Invites Us To Look Deeply At The Biggest Mystery, The Mystery Of Our Own Identity. By That I Don’t Mean, Of Course, Our Name. I Mean&nbsp;our Identity In The Cosmos.</div><div><br></div><div>There Is No “right Answer” To This Question, There Is Only The Answer You Give.The Second Question Seems Simple, But Its Answer May Not Be. Where Am I?Where Do You Conceive Of Yourself As Being? That Is, What Is This Place In Which We Experience Our Existence? How Do You Conceive Of It? How Do You Hold It In Your Reality?</div><div><br></div><div>I Am Speaking Here Of How You Hold It Conceptually, Yes? I’m Not Talking About Your Physical Description Of This Place (“I Live On Planet Earth. It Is The Third Rock From The Sun...,” Etc.), I Am Referring To Your Conceptual Understanding Of This Space. Is It A Place Of Learning, A School?&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Do You Experience It As A Place Of Testing, An Examination Room? Is It A Place Of Proving Or Contesting Or Competing, Like A Giant Racetrack Or An Athletic Field, Where Some Are Winners And Some Are Losers?</div><div><br></div><div>Do You&nbsp;have&nbsp;no Conceptual Reference Point For This Space, And Truly Conceive Of It Only As A Physical Location In A Larger System Of Planets Whizzing Around A Star?</div><div><br></div><div>What Is This Place In Which We Find Ourselves? The Mind Begs To Know...Where Am I?</div><div><br></div><div>Again, There Is No “right” Answer To This Question. Yet Until I Gave It&nbsp;some&nbsp;answer, I Had No Conceptual Framework Within Which To Hold My Life’s Experience. And Absent Such A Framework, Those Experiences Themselves Felt Essentially Meaningless. No Different From Those Of A Fly Or An Ant. I Felt That I Was Simply A More Sophisticated Life Form. I Had A Life Expectancy And, Barring Unforeseen Circumstances, I Knew I Would Be Here For X Amount Of Time, But What&nbsp;is&nbsp;this Place?</div><div><br></div><div>And Then, The Next Question Looms:&nbsp;Why?</div><div><br></div><div>Why&nbsp;am&nbsp;I Where I Am? Why Am I Not Somewhere Else?&nbsp;Is&nbsp;there A “somewhere Else”? What Is The&nbsp;purpose&nbsp;of My Being In This Time And Place?&nbsp;Is&nbsp;there A Purpose? Who Would Give It One?I Don’t Know How A Person Advances In Their Evolution Without Giving Some Thought—and Eventually, Some Sort Of Answer—to These Questions.Many People Respond To These Questions With A Curt “I Don’t Know” And Let It Go At That. I Couldn’t Do That. And I Don’t Encourage Any True Students Of Life To Do That. If They Truly Don’t Have An Answer, I Encourage Them To Create One. That Is,decide&nbsp;what Their Answer Is, Out Of Pure Intention. In This Way They Live Their Life From Intention Rather Than Living Their Life By Default.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>A Life Lived By Default Is A Life Lived According To The Default Responses Of The Majority Of People On The Earth. I Hope That None Of You Ever Again Chooses To Live Your Life Like That. Most Of Us Have Lived At Least Portions Of Our Lives In This Way, But We Never Have To Again If We Do Not Want To.</div><div><br></div><div><b>The Last Inquiry</b></div><div><br></div><div>This Leads To The Final Question. Not Just The Final Question In This Series Of Seven, But What Could Be, Metaphorically, The Final Important Question Of Life: Having Given Your Answers To All The Other Questions, You Are Invited To Decide,What Do You Intend To Do About That?This Is Always The Final Question In Life. In Every Situation, In Every Circumstance, In Every Moment That Our Experience Presents, The Question Always And Forever Is:&nbsp;What Do I Intend To Do About That?</div><div><br></div><div>Life Proceeds Out Of Your Intentions For It. This Is The Fuel That Drives The Engine Of Creation In Your Life.It Is Important To Understand That Life Is Nothing But Energy. It Is Energyorganized. And Who Does The Organizing?&nbsp;We Do. Surprisingly, The Answer Is...us.Life Is Pure Energy That Circles Back Into Itself. That Is, Life Is A Self-fuelling, Self-sustaining, Self-determining, And Self-creating Process. It Depends On Itself, Relies On Itself, And Looks To Itself To Tell Itself What The Next Expression Of Itself Shall Be.This Is True Universally, It Is True Globally, It Is True Nationally, It Is True Locally, And It Is True Individually. It Is Merely A Matter Of Proportion. And So We See The Universe Deciding About Itself In This Way, Our Planet Deciding About Itself In This Way, Our Nation Deciding About Itself In This Way, Our Own City Or Community Deciding About Itself In This Way, And Our Own Person Deciding About Itself In This Way.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Life&nbsp;informs&nbsp;Life&nbsp;about&nbsp;Life&nbsp;through The Process Of Life Itself.Why Am I Where I Am? Why Am I Not Somewhere Else? Is There A “somewhere Else”? What Is The Purpose Of My Being In This Time And Place? Is There A Purpose? Who Would Give It One?</div><div><br></div><div>Life’s Information Creates Life In Formation. At The Most Personal Level, Your Information Creates You, In Formation. You Are Constantly Forming And Reforming Yourself, Shaping And Reshaping Yourself, Creating And Re-creating Yourself Anew. Indeed, The Function Of Life Is To Re-create Yourself Anew In Each Golden Moment Of Now, In The Next Grandest Version Of The Greatest Vision Ever You Held About Who You Are.</div><div><br></div><div>That’s All Of It, In A Nutshell. That’s What’s Going On Here. All Of Humanity Is&nbsp;engaged In This Process. We Are Doing It Politically, We Are Doing It Economically, We Are Doing It Culturally, We Are Doing It Racially, We Are Doing It Socially, We Are Doing It Sexually, We Are Doing It Spiritually. This Is All We Are Doing And&nbsp;we’re Not Doing Anything Else.</div><div><br></div><div>This Is What God Is Doing. God Is Re-creating Itself Anew In The Single And Only Moment Called Now—and Life Is God,&nbsp;doing This. Life Is God, Expressing Itself In An Endless Multiplicity Of Forms. You Are One Of The Forms Of God. You Are, All Of You, God’s Information. And Thus, Gods... In Formation.</div>"

Panesar who is credited with the introduction of many important young artists in Kolkata, including&nbsp;Devajyoti Ray,&nbsp; is said to have adopted Shakila as her foster daughter.

		"title" : "10 Tips to Help You Become a Better Photographer",
		"description" : "1. <b>Learn Where You Need To Improve:</b><br>Before Getting Better At Anything, You Need To Work Out What You \r\nActually Need To Work On. Write A List Of Things You Don’t Feel \r\nConfident With, It Can Be As Long Or As Short As You Like But Try To \r\nKeep Each One As Narrow As Possible. When You Have Your List, \r\nConcentrate On Just One Item From It And Spend Time Practising, \r\nResearching And Doing Everything You Can To Improve That Particular \r\nAspect Of Your Photography. When You Feel Confident With It, Cross It \r\nOff And Move Onto The Next One.\r\n<br><br>2. <b>Be Critical:</b><br>When You Take A Photograph That You’re Not Happy With, Don’t Just \r\nScrap It. Spend Some Time Looking At It And Work Out What You Don’t Like\r\n About It. Write Your Thoughts Down So You Can Look Back Over Them \r\nLater. You Might Start To Find A Pattern Where It’s The Same Things That\r\n You Aren’t Happy With. If That’s The Case, Go Back And Add It To Your \r\nList.\r\n<br><br>3. <b>Set Yourself Assignments:</b><br>A Great Way To Improve Your Photography When You Know What It Is That\r\n Needs Improving, Is To Set Yourself Assignments. This Gives You A \r\nChallenge, Something To Aim Towards And It Helps Keep You On The Right \r\nPath. Make It Achievable Though And Preferably Something That You Will \r\nEnjoy Doing. If, For Example, You Want To Improve Your Close Up Animal \r\nShots, Don’t Just Take A Thousand Photographs Of The Dog, Set Yourself A\r\n Challenge That Will Take You Out Of Your Comfort Zone, Like Getting \r\nYourself A Shot Of A Squirrel Holding A Nut.\r\n<br><br>4. <b>Try New Things:</b><br>The Worst Thing You Can Do Is Take Shot After Shot Of The Same \r\nThings, With The Same Settings. Even If There’s Something You’re \r\nBrilliant At, It’s Always Good To Make Changes To Make Sure You Don’t \r\nGet Complacent. You Might Learn Something That Will Improve What You Are\r\n Already Great At But It’s Even More Important For Beginners, Trying New\r\n Things Will Definitely Speed Up The Learning Process.\r\n<br><br>5. <b>Be Patient:</b><br>Don’t Expect Brilliant Results Instantly, Becoming A Great Photographer \r\nTakes Time And Isn’t Something That Can Be Learned Overnight. It’s Even \r\nMore Important When You Are Completing Your Smaller Tasks To Not Give Up\r\n At The First Sign Of Failure.\r\n<br><br>6. <b>Find Inspiration:</b><br>When You Are Feeling Confident With Your Camera And You Want To \r\nExperiment A Little, It Can Be A Challenge To Come Up With New Ideas And\r\n It Might Be A Good Idea To Take Inspiration From Other People’s Work. \r\nLook Around The Internet, In Magazines, Even In Shopping Malls Where \r\nThere Can Be Many Promotional Posters. Try Taking Ideas From The \r\nMaterial Rather Than Copying Them, So You Can Develop Your Own Unique \r\nStyle.\r\n<br><br>7.<b> Learn From The Best:\r\n</b><br>Following On From Finding Inspiration, Take Some Of That Inspiration \r\nAnd Work Out What Makes It Great. Critique The Photographer’s Work, Look\r\n At Why That Particular Shot Is So Good, What Do Their Photographs Have \r\nThat Yours Don’t? This Is A Great Way Of Improving Your Own Photography,\r\n As You Look Closer At Photographs Rather Than Just Thinking ‘that Looks\r\n Nice’ And Moving On To The Next.\r\n<br><br>8. <b>Shoot, Shoot And Shoot Again:</b><br>There’s No Better Way To Learn Than Getting Out There And \r\nExperimenting. You Can Read A Million Books But You Will Still Learn \r\nFaster Just By Doing It And Learnig From Your Own Mistakes. Spend Some \r\nTime Taking Shots Of The Same Subject Over And Over Again In Different \r\nWays. It Could Also Be A Good Idea To Record What Settings You Used For \r\nEach Photo So You Can Work Out What Worked The Best When You Look Back \r\nOver Them Later.\r\n<br><br>9.<b> Listen To Feedback:\r\n</b><br>When You Are Improving, Get Other Opinions Instead Of Just Judging \r\nYour Own Work. There Are Plenty Of People Out There Willing To Help Your\r\n Photography, Even If They Don’t Realise It. Tell People You Don’t Just \r\nWant To Know If They Like A Shot Or Not, But You Want To Know What They \r\nLike Or Don’t Like About It. Also, It’s Not Just Other Photographer’s \r\nYou Want Feedback From. People Who Have No Idea About Photography Can \r\nStill Give An Opinion That Could Make You Realize Something You Could \r\nHave Done To Improve The Shot, So Get Feedback From As Many Different \r\nSources As Possible.\r\n<br><br>10. <b>Don’t Give Up:</b><br>The Final Tip Is The Most Important Of Them All. If You Really Want \r\nTo Become An Amazing Photographer, It Takes Time, Dedication And \r\nCommitment. Everyone Has To Start Somewhere, And Many People Do Give Up \r\nWhen They Get Impatient Or Frustrated, But Stick With It And You Will \r\nGet There."

The Rabbits Are Killed After The Experiment Is\r\n Over. And Even Though Internationally Accepted Non-animal Methods \r\nExist, In Skin Corrosion Tests, Rabbits’ Backs Are Shaved And Corrosive Chemicals Are Applied To Their Raw Skin\r\n And Left There For Up To Two Weeks. These Chemicals Often Burn The \r\nSkin, Leading To Tissue Damage. Rabbits Are Also Given No Pain Relief \r\nDuring This Excruciatingly Painful Test, And After The Test Is Finished,\r\n They Are Killed.At Professional Laboratory And Research Services, Inc.,\r\n A Product Testing Laboratory In North Carolina, Workers Attached \r\nThousands Of Ticks Onto Rabbits’ Shaved Bodies To Allow The Ticks To \r\nGorge For Five Days. Rabbits Were Subjected To This Painful Procedure \r\nTwice And Were Then Killed, Even Though Non-animal Methods For Raising \r\nTicks Have Been Available Since The Mid-’90s. In Addition To Being\r\n Subjected To These Cruel Chemical Tests, Rabbits Are Used In \r\nExperiments To Study Cardiovascular Disease, Skin Conditions, And Spinal\r\n Cord Injuries. Experimenters At The University Of Utah\r\n Cut Deep Incisions Into Rabbits’ Backs And Surgically Inserted Implants\r\n Into Their Spines. The Surgically Mutilated Rabbits Were Observed For \r\n24 Weeks And Then Killed."

		"description" : "Air pollution takes place when chemicals contaminate&nbsp; the atmosphere affecting its structure and composition and&nbsp; producing significant harmful effects on human health, animals, vegetation and environmental quality.&nbsp; Air pollutants can be classified according to their&nbsp; origin:&nbsp; <br>• anthropocentric&nbsp; (man-made) sources, which are the result of various human activities;&nbsp; <br>• natural&nbsp; sources such as fire particles, volcanic eruptions&nbsp; and degradation of organic matter.&nbsp; <br>Contaminants can also be classified as:&nbsp; <br>• primary pollutants, such as sulphur dioxide or nitrogen monoxide, which are directly emitted into the&nbsp; atmosphere from its sources;&nbsp; <br>• secondary pollutants, as ozone, which are formed as a result of chemical reactions in the atmosphere.&nbsp; <br><br>Anthropogenic pollution is caused by major stationary point sources as industries, incinerators and thermoelectric plants, minor stationary point sources as domestic heating&nbsp; systems, and by mobile point sources such as vehicular traffic.<br><br>Consequences of air pollution&nbsp; <br>Some pollutants, if they are present in excessive quantities, can produce chemical and physical alterations of the air hampering its capacity to “work” correctly and guarantee our survival functions. Men’s activity usually originates&nbsp; pollutants (anthropogenic origin), although in some&nbsp; cases natural sources contribute significantly. Mo st of human-origin&nbsp; air pollution derives either from fossil fuels (their combustion is necessary to produce energy) or fr om industrial chemical&nbsp; processes. The environmental impact of air pollutants is variable: some compounds mainly act at local level, where they&nbsp; are produced and distributed, while others affect entire regions.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some others have an impact on the whole planet. In fact, some atmospheric agents have a short life (a few hours or a&nbsp; few days) and after that they fall on the ground, while other pollutants keep active for long periods&nbsp; and can spread on a&nbsp; wider area. This type of pollutants can have an influence on environmental conditions at a continental, sometimes even&nbsp; planetary level, with a negative impact on human health, even in places that are far away from the source of pollution. In most cases, the type and quantity of pollutants emitted into the atmosphere depend on the nature of the energy sources that are used and on the raw materials that men use during&nbsp; production processes.<br><br>For example in China – Millions Of Chinese Citizens Die Each Year From\r\nPollution-related Health Problems – But Breathing Ailments Aren't The Only\r\nIssues Brought On By The Smog That Is Unrelenting.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>A Recent Report Revealed That Smog In China And Germany (the\r\nCountries Where The Large-scale Study Ended Up Being Performed) Is Also\r\nAccountable For The Forming Of Lentigines – Dark Areas Of Skin Also Called\r\n\"liver Spots.\"\r\n\r\n&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In Addition To\r\nParticulate Matter, Traffic-related Air Pollution Is Characterized By Increased\r\nConcentration Of Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2). The Aftereffect Of NO2 On Human Skin\r\nHas Never Been Investigated While NO2 Exposure Is Well Known To Be Associated With\r\nLow Lung Function And Lung Cancer. This Is Really Important Because\r\nEnvironmentally-induced Skin And Lung Aging Be Seemingly Closely Related.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The Study Involved 806 Caucasian Women That Are German 743\r\nHan Chinese Women From The Taizhou Area. The Exposure To NO2 Among These Two\r\nGroups Was Found To Cause The Formation Lentigines On The Area That Is Facial.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>No Relationship Was Seen Between Levels Of NO2 And\r\n[lentigines'] Formation On The Rear Of The Hands Or Forearms, However,\r\nExperience Of NO2 Was Considerably Connected With More [lentigines] On The\r\nCheeks In Both German And Ladies That Are Chinese Than 50 Years. Overall, An\r\nIncrease Of 10 µg/m3 In NO2 Concentration Ended Up Being Related To About 25%\r\nMore Spots That Are Dark.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>It's Not Astonishing To Discover That Heavy Air Pollution\r\nCauses Epidermis Problems Such As Respiratory Ailments, Particularly In\r\nCountries Such As China Where The Fresh Quality Of Air Is Extremely Poor In\r\nLots Of Cities.

Is this actually what the modern world women deserve? On one side we fight for women rights on the other hand we suppress them as their husbands somehow end up “Owning” them?&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>First of all, what is marital rape?</div><div>Marital Rape is a form of forceful sexual activity which is actually performed on the victim by a person they are married to.</div><div><br></div><div>It’s a fact, Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) considers the forced sex in marriages as a crime only when the wife is below age 15. Thus, marital rape is not considered to be a criminal offense under the IPC.</div><div><br></div><div>But is this actually justified?&nbsp;According to the Indian system, a marriage is a sacred knot which is tied between a man and a women.</div><div><br></div><div>Marriage is said to &nbsp;join two individuals for life, so that they can pursue dharma (duty), artha (possessions), Kama (physical desires), and moksha (ultimate spiritual release) \"together\".</div><div><br></div><div>Marital rape on the other hand is the act of Kama, which is being forced on the wife by her own husband, which I believe is definitely not done \"together\".</div><div><br></div><div>Also, we can look at it this way,The act of hurting your spouse physically (Domestic Violence) is a recognised crime under the section 498a of Indian Penal Code.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The act of physically abusing a person in the sexual context (Sexual Abuse) is a recognised crime under the IPC.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>So why is the act of the act of hurting your spouse physically by abusing them in the sexual context not a recognised crime?</div><div><br></div><div>It is believed that as a developing country we tend to follow the trends and examples laid by the super power countries like The United States Of America and marital rape is lawfully declared as form of partner rape, of domestic violence, and of sexual abuse there.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Today, marital rape is illegal in all 50 US states.</div><div><br></div><div>Why do we fail to follow or adapt to these examples left by the US?</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;It is horrific to imagine, how does a case like this arise?Since when is a woman’s body owned by the man after tying the knot?&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>We talk about meeting of hearts in a wedding not selling or trading of a body as a commodity.</div><div><br></div><div>Why do men have the notion that it’s their right to use their Wife’s bodies as and when they please?</div><div><br></div><div>It’s high time, either we take a move to break these notions, Which is right or we let this rope in our country’s &nbsp;women’s neck go tight.</div>"

		"description" : "<div><br></div>If You Would Ask Students What Education Actually Is, You Would Receive A Huge Variety Of Answers. Some Would Say That It Is To Get Into A Great College, Some Would Say It Is To Be Able To Initiate A Great Career Or To Learn.This Makes People Wonder, Does Education Actually Have A Purpose? Or Is It Just Another Burden On The Children Of Our Society? The Truth Is Education In Itself Is An Essence, It Is An Enlightening Experience. It Is Basically The Acquisition Of Knowledge, Skills, Values, Beliefs, That Helps People Develop A Thought Process And Helps Them Revaluate Social Norms, Rethink About Existing Rules And Regulations In The Society.Thinking Is What Actually Changes The Thought Process Of People And Helps The People Change Their Society For Better.Education Provides A New Beginning To The Stories Where People Thought That There Were Only Endings.The Main Purpose Of Education Is To Adapt To The Ever-changing And Dynamic Society And To Be Able To Open Our Tiny Minds To New Concepts And Facts Coming Our WayEducation Is Meant To Open Our Minds And Extend Our Knowledge Therefore I Would Totally Agree With Mr. Sydney.J.Harris As The Only Things You See In A Mirror Are Your Own Reflections And A Very Limited Area Around You. &nbsp;However, When You Look Out A Window, The View Can Be Almost Endless.Without Education, A Person’s Opportunities In Life Can Be Very Narrow And Limited. &nbsp;However, The More Education A Person Obtains, The More Doors Will Open For Them Towards A Very Bright And Vibrant Future.Education Is A Process Of Learning To Look Beyond Yourself, And To See The Rest Of The World More Clearly. This Is Particularly True For Those Who Have Benefited From The Opportunities Offered By International Education Partnerships. I Have Never Met Anyone Who, After Studying Or Teaching Abroad, Did Not Feel That Windows And Doors To The World Had Opened Wide To Them – That They Had Seen Far Beyond What They Had Previously Perceived To Be The HorizonThis Reminds Me Of Another Very Famous Quote That Is “Education Is Learning What You Didn't Even Know You Didn't Know.” By Mr. Daniel J. BoorstinWe Must Realize That Knowledge Is Unlimited, It Is Never Ending One Can Never Be Completely Educated Or Learned, The More You Learn The More You Question The Prevailing Norms The More Changes Take Place In The Society And We Evolve.Being Well Educated Never Only Means To Earn Certificates And Good Salary From The Recognized And Reputed Organization, Companies Or Institutions However It Also Means To Be A Good And Social Person In The Life. It Helps Us To Determine Whether Something Is Good Or Bad For Us And Other Persons Related To Us. In Such A Competitive World, Education Has Become A Necessity For Human Beings After Food, Clothes And Shelter. It Is Able To Provide Solutions To All Problems; It Promotes Good Habits And Awareness About Corruption, Terrorism, And Other Social Issues Among Us.Education Is The Most Important Tool Offers Inner And Outer Strength To A Person. Education Is The Fundamental Rights Of Everyone And Capable Of Bringing Any Desired Change And In The Human Mind And Society.In Such A Modern, Technological And Competitive World, There Is Still The Issue Of Education Among Poor And Uneducated People Of The Society Which Needs To Be Solved As Soon As Possible As Education Is A Birth Right..&nbsp;I Would Also Like To Address The Very Important Issue Of Sexual Abuse, Rapes And Mistreatment Of Women In Our Society, A Well Educated Will Be Able To Take Steps Towards Improvement Of The Same, He/she Will Be Able To Help Alter The Mindset Of Men Towards Women And This Is Actually All That Women Empowerment Is About, Educating Women And Making Them Stand Equal And Right Next To Men,In The End, I Would Like To Present My Personal Views On The Topic Or Quote,I Think This Topic Basically Means That Education Is Important Because As You Get Older You Get Wiser And That Education You Have In The Back Of Your Mind Will Help You Accomplish Bigger And Better Things In Life.Education Is The Highest And The Most Extraordinary Award You Can Get. You Just Have To Make Use Of It.Education Is The Key To Everything. Whenever You Learn Something It Takes You To A Higher Place And The More You Learn The Further You Get.&nbsp;Mirrors Let You See The Same Constant Thing And The Windows Are The Evolution Of That. The Mirrors Let You See Limits. Education Opens The Mirrors Up, Turning Them Into Windows, To Give You An Opportunity Of Being Able To See And Do New Things. The Purpose Or Aim Is To Actually Be Able To Grab What Is Outside For Example &nbsp;like What The Teacher Is Saying In Class And Put It In Your Mind Because Next Thing You Know, The Window Might Be Closed Forever.&nbsp;Education Is A Very Powerful Thing ,Education Can Get You Things And Can Take You To Many Places In Life. With Education You Can Discover Things And Become Talented In Its Real Sense. Having A Education Is Very Important Because Without It You Will Actually See Yourself As A Very Boring Person.It Is Possible To Be Able To Store A Million Facts In Our Minds But Still Be Entirely Uneducated.&nbsp;Education Isn't How Much You Have Mugged Up And In Memory, Or Even How Much You Know. It's Being Able &nbsp;to Differentiate Between What &nbsp;you Do Know And What You Don't.Education Is The Ability To Listen To Almost Anything Without Losing Your Temper Or Your Self Confidence &nbsp;as Someone Who Doesn’t Believe In Himself &nbsp;can Never Influence The Society"

Through Continued Practice Yoga Postures Can Have A Profound Effect On The Inner Dimensions Of Life Establishing Deep Calm Concentration Emotional Stability And Confidence.

Van Eyck Took Advantage Of The Longer Drying Time Of Oil Paint, Compared To Tempera, To Blend Colours By Painting Wet-in-wet To Achieve Subtle Variations In Light And Shade To Heighten The Illusion Of Three-dimensional Forms. The Medium Of Oil Paint Also Permitted Van Eyck To Capture Surface Appearance And Distinguish Textures Precisely. He Also Rendered The Effects Of Both Direct And Diffuse Light By Showing The Light From The Window On The Left Reflected By Various Surfaces.

She Smells Good. It's The Burberry Perfume I Had Picked Up For Her The Last Time I Went To Dubai. I Turn Her Around To Face Me. She Has Beautiful Doe Eyes. Lined In Black And Sprinkled With Just The Right Amount Of Sparkly Grey, She Looks Up At Me And Smiles. She Does Have A Beautiful Smile. It Lights Up Her Face. My Attention Is Momentarily Diverted By The Swipe Of Her Tongue Over Her Lips, Reminding Me Of Long, Sweaty Nights. She Smiles Again, Knowingly This Time.&nbsp;</font></p></div><div data-blogger-escaped-style=\"margin-bottom: .0001pt; Margin: 0in; Text-align: Justify;\" style=\"margin: 0in;\"><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0px;\"><font data-blogger-escaped-style=\"font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, Serif; Font-size: Large;\" face=\"&quot;georgia&quot; , &quot;times New Roman&quot; , Serif\"><i>No, Baby, I Don't Think You Can Read My Mind Right Now.

She Holds Up Her Keys, Raises Her Eyebrows In Question. In The 18 Months That We Have Been Together, She Has Come To Know How Particular I Am About Always Carrying My Own Set Of Keys. I Had Left Them Behind, But I Nod In Affirmation. I Won't Need Those Keys After Tonight.</font></p></div><div data-blogger-escaped-style=\"margin-bottom: .0001pt; Margin: 0in; Text-align: Justify;\" style=\"margin: 0in;\"><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0px;\"><font data-blogger-escaped-style=\"font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, Serif; Font-size: Large;\" face=\"&quot;georgia&quot; , &quot;times New Roman&quot; , Serif\">The Black SUV Parked In The Basement Had Cost Me A Pretty Penny. They Pay Me Well For The Kind Of Work I Do. Besides, The Cost Of The Car Was Covered In The Expense Account. My Personal Bank Account In The Cayman Islands Has Already Been Credited With The Fees I Command . . . All In Advance. They Know That When I'm Hired, I Finish The Job. &nbsp;</font></p></div><div data-blogger-escaped-style=\"margin-bottom: .0001pt; Margin: 0in; Text-align: Justify;\" style=\"margin: 0in;\"><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0px;\"><font data-blogger-escaped-style=\"font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, Serif; Font-size: Large;\" face=\"&quot;georgia&quot; , &quot;times New Roman&quot; , Serif\">I Put The Gearstick On Drive And Pull The Vehicle Out Of The Parking Lot Onto The Busy Road. I Had Already Driven On That Route Enough Times In The Past Month To Know That We'll Reach The Hotel In 24 Minutes Or Less After Starting At 6:50 In The Evening. She Turns On The Stereo And I Smile And Pretend To Enjoy 'Kings Of Leon' As She Bobs Her Head To The Music. Her Earrings, With Tiny Bells On Them, Tinkle With Every Shake Of Her Head. This Is So Annoying. Personally, I Prefer The Classics. Give Me Mozart Or Bach Any Day. I Like How They Soothe Your Nerves And Help You Think More Clearly, Plan More Clearly.</font></p></div><div data-blogger-escaped-style=\"margin-bottom: .0001pt; Margin: 0in; Text-align: Justify;\" style=\"margin: 0in;\"><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0px;\"><font data-blogger-escaped-style=\"font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, Serif; Font-size: Large;\" face=\"&quot;georgia&quot; , &quot;times New Roman&quot; , Serif\">We Reach In Under 22 Minutes. The Place Is Already Thronging With The Who's Who Of Politics And The Media. Security Is Very Tight. Nothing I Didn't Expect. Roshan, The Head Of Security, Is Doing His Job Well. Right Now, He's At The Entrance. I Hand Over My Mobile Phone And The Small Bag With My Camera Equipment. The Officer At The Entrance Picks It Up And Puts It Through The X-ray Machine For A Thorough Check. Smooth Sailing. Wait! Not Yet. Roshan Comes Forward And Picks Up My Bag, As If With Half A Mind To Open And Check Its Contents. That Is When He Sees Her, Pink Suit, Tinkling Earrings And All, And His Face Splits Into A Friendly Smile. They Had Met Each Other In Passing On A Few Previous Gatherings. She Explains That I Am Her Plus One. He Lets Us Pass After A Few Minutes Of Friendly Chatter And A Wave Of His Big Hand. 18 Months Just Paid Off.&nbsp;</font></p></div><div data-blogger-escaped-style=\"margin-bottom: .0001pt; Margin: 0in; Text-align: Justify;\" style=\"margin: 0in;\"><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0px;\"><font data-blogger-escaped-style=\"font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, Serif; Font-size: Large;\" face=\"&quot;georgia&quot; , &quot;times New Roman&quot; , Serif\">The Huge Banquet Hall In The Hotel Is Alive With Conversation And The Clink Of Wineglasses. Everyone Who Is Here Is A Public Figure. This Massive Gathering Is A Conglomeration Of Some Very Influential People Who Have The Collective Power Of Making Or Breaking An Entire Nation. If Not For The Plus One, I Would Have Easily Needed Another Six Months To Get Here On My Own.</font></p></div><div data-blogger-escaped-style=\"margin-bottom: .0001pt; Margin: 0in; Text-align: Justify;\" style=\"margin: 0in;\"><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0px;\"><font data-blogger-escaped-style=\"font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, Serif; Font-size: Large;\" face=\"&quot;georgia&quot; , &quot;times New Roman&quot; , Serif\">Like A Pro, She Maneuvers Her Way Through The Bevy Of Waiters Carrying Trays Of Hors D'oeuvres And Makes A Beeline For The Group Of Fellow Editors. I Follow Her And Exchange The Expected Pleasantries With The Few People That I Know And Get Introduced To A Few That I Don't. Time Is Of Essence. And My Time Is Precious. I Excuse Myself.</font></p></div><div data-blogger-escaped-style=\"margin-bottom: .0001pt; Margin: 0in; Text-align: Justify;\" style=\"margin: 0in;\"><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0px;\"><font data-blogger-escaped-style=\"font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, Serif; Font-size: Large;\" face=\"&quot;georgia&quot; , &quot;times New Roman&quot; , Serif\">According To Plan, I Take The Ornate Corridor Leading To The Staff Restrooms On The Ground Floor. I Walk By Some Security Personnel With Impassive Faces Holding Some Very Impressive Firearms. Thanks To The Tag Around My Neck With ‘PRESS’ Written In Huge Red Letters, I Get Access Without Raising Any Eyebrows. I Reach The Restroom And Push The Door Open. As Expected, There Is No One Inside. Every Member Of The Staff Is Busy Catering To The Crowd Outside. I Put The Camera Bag On The Counter That Holds A Line Of Three White Sinks In Italian Marble. What A Waste! The Thought Of Decimating Such Fine Pieces Of Art Is A Shame. My Dinner Jacket Is A Bit Snug; I Don't Like Working In The Confines Of Restrictive Clothing. I Take It Off. Now The Camera Bag. I Unzip The Bag Carefully, So As Not To Disturb Any Of The Multicolored Wires Attached To The Beautiful Piece Of Work Inside. Here It Is! Straight From The Land Of The Communists. Roshan Has Done His Job Well. He Was Quick Enough That No One Saw Him Replace The Camera Bag With An Identical One. With The Cumulative Four Million Dollars Sitting In His Six Bank Accounts, He Can Easily Disappear Into Neverland Until The Authorities Close The File On Him.&nbsp;</font></p></div><div data-blogger-escaped-style=\"margin-bottom: .0001pt; Margin: 0in; Text-align: Justify;\" style=\"margin: 0in;\"><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0px;\"><font data-blogger-escaped-style=\"font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, Serif; Font-size: Large;\" face=\"&quot;georgia&quot; , &quot;times New Roman&quot; , Serif\">What Is Inside The Bag Is A Brilliant, Compact Piece Of Work; No Bigger Than A Camera. Yet, Its Effect, I Know From Experience, Is A Hundredfold. They Will Not Forget This Easily. The Last Time I Saw Something This Beautiful Was In Afghanistan Seven Years Ago.&nbsp;</font></p></div><div data-blogger-escaped-style=\"margin-bottom: .0001pt; Margin: 0in; Text-align: Justify;\" style=\"margin: 0in;\"><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0px;\"><font data-blogger-escaped-style=\"font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, Serif; Font-size: Large;\" face=\"&quot;georgia&quot; , &quot;times New Roman&quot; , Serif\">I Put My Hands Inside Gently, As Though Reaching For A Lover's Body. Click! There Is A Small, Almost Dismissible, Sound From The Other Side Of The Door. My Fingers Pause. My Ears Strain. I Quickly Take The Glock Out From The Small Compartment In The Camera Bag And Cover The Bag With My Dinner Jacket. I Turn Around To Face The Door With My Hand On My Gun. Too Late! A Sharp, Piercing Pain To The Left Of My Chest. My Breathing Stops. The Last Thing I See Is A Flurry Of Pink And The Glitter Of Gold Earrings That Make A Tinkling Sound - Like Bells.</font></p></div><div data-blogger-escaped-style=\"margin-bottom: .0001pt; Margin: 0in; Text-align: Justify;\" style=\"margin: 0in;\"><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0px;\">-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p></div><div data-blogger-escaped-style=\"margin-bottom: .0001pt; Margin: 0in; Text-align: Justify;\" style=\"margin: 0in;\"><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0px;\"><font data-blogger-escaped-style=\"font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, Serif; Font-size: Large;\" face=\"&quot;georgia&quot; , &quot;times New Roman&quot; , Serif\">She Looks Down At The Spreading Circle Of Red On His White Shirt. Egyptian Cotton That Almost Feels Like Silk. She Had Bought That Shirt For Him And Admired How He Looked In It This Evening. He Had Always Been A Looker. She Picks Up The Dinner Jacket And The Camera Bag. There Was Only One Person Other Than Him Who Had Touched That Camera Bag From The Time It Left The X-ray Machine Till He Entered The Restroom. It Won't Be Difficult To Connect Roshan To The Crime And Seal The Security Breach. You Just Have To Follow The Money Trail.&nbsp;</font></p></div><div data-blogger-escaped-style=\"margin-bottom: .0001pt; Margin: 0in; Text-align: Justify;\" style=\"margin: 0in;\"><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0px;\"><font data-blogger-escaped-style=\"font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, Serif; Font-size: Large;\" face=\"&quot;georgia&quot; , &quot;times New Roman&quot; , Serif\">Someone Will Clean Up The Mess In The Restroom.

		"description" : "Today, let me raise a question; let’s see how many people out there are like me. <br>\r\nHave you ever actually felt like nothing can be done and sit alone, in the dark, look out of the window at the beautiful night and somehow, find hope and strength? <br>\r\n&nbsp;Like somehow you realize that all roads end somewhere and the same way, sorrow will eventually pass the torch to happiness? <br>\r\nActually, I never quite understand the fear of the dark or the fear of the night, It’s quite funny how people always somehow end up fearing the dark even though we never quite know why. <br>\r\nThere's an electricity in the moon. A pulse, a magic, an energy. A bewitching entrancement unlike that of the sun. <br>\r\nThe moon is for things unseen, things done in the shadows and beneath the fog. Under bridges and beneath bed sheets — it's for wild hearts and unconcerned minds. <br>\r\nIt's where plans are made in dark alleyways and secrets revealed under the soft haze of light coming through the cracks of closed shutters. <br>\r\nIt's by night that we see our true desires. <br>\r\n&nbsp;We reflect on our moments of unhappiness and those yearnings that are momentarily blinded by the sun. <br>\r\n&nbsp;It's when we become poets and philosophers, martyrs and murderers. <br>\r\n&nbsp;It's when we form regrets of days past and that profound hatred for those who hurt us. <br>\r\nIt's when we choke on our tears through deep sobs that can only pour onto dark pillowcases. The night is for passion. It's for fanaticism, romance and trouble. <br>\r\n&nbsp;It's when your most tender, authentic and suppressed sides come out to play under the nonjudgmental eyes of the stars. <br>\r\n&nbsp;It's for all those things you could never dream of doing by day, under the watchful eyes of the sun. <br>\r\nP.C. Cast, author of the ‘House of Night’ series has rightly said, “Darkness doesn’t always amount to evil and light doesn’t always amount to good”. <br>\r\nIf you said yes to any of my questions, congratulations, you’re a night owl and yes, you’re more intelligent than most of your peers. <br>\r\nA night owl, evening person or simply owl, is a person who tends to stay up until late at night and relate to the night. <br>\r\nIt's only natural that those who go to bed earlier never experience the psychological and emotional changes that occur under the blanket of darkness. <br>\r\n&nbsp;According to “Psychology Today,” intelligent people are more likely to be nocturnal than people with lower IQ scores. In a study run on young Americans, results showed that intelligent individuals went to bed later on weeknights and weekends than their less intelligent counterparts. <br>\r\nIn “Study Magazine,” Satoshi Kanazawa, a psychologist at the London School Of Economics And Political Science, reported that IQ average and sleeping patterns are most definitely related, proving that those who play under the moon are, indeed, more intelligent human beings.&nbsp;<br>"

It’s a proven fact that relaxing comfort food like chocolate or chips help us release stress in huge quantities. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2)\tGet physical, yes, studies have shown that exercising releases happy hormones in our body and helps us get over stress in a healthy manner. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n3)\tPhone a friend! Calling up a friend and sharing everything on your mind, instantly helps us get over stuff easily and uplifts our mood. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n4)\tCRY. I won’t sugarcoat this for you, if you feel sad, you should cry. This won’t make you wrong or a cry-baby, in fact, this helps you express your emotions positively. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n5)\t Know that the pain you are feeling is normal. it It is normal to feel sad, angry, frightened, and other emotions as well. You might be worried that you will end up alone or that you won’t be happy again. Just remind yourself that it is normal to feel this way. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n6)\tMusic! Music usually lightens up the mood a bit and helps dry up a few tears. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>"

If you&nbsp; Suicidal,&nbsp; change the subject, or divert your mind from what you were planning to do. Walk, jog, bike, swim, take a nap, take a hot shower, watch a movie, listen to music, read a book, do household chores, clean, go shopping, go to the park, etc. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n2) Remove whatever can harm you at that very moment. <br>\r\nIf there are guns, knives, and pills in your house, then run from your house. Get away from anything you can use to hurt yourself. This will buy you time to settle down and begin to think rationally. Some people are most suicidal when they are drunk. Have someone you know and trust clear all those things out of your house and vehicle. Remember, when you are suicidal, time is your friend. It is in time that we begin to think far more clearly. <br>\r\n<br>\r\n3) Realize you will die if you believe the lie. <br>\r\nThe lie is that suicide will solve all your problems. This is one of the greatest lies of all. It implies there is no other way out of your predicament than to end your life. <br>\r\nYou may be feeling extremely overwhelmed right now. It probably feels like the pain is never going to go away. Remember: the pain is temporary, but suicide is forever. We can never escape all of life’s difficult challenges. In one form or another they will always be there. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nBut if you courageously take that first step away from suicide, and find healthy ways to deal with these challenges, you will be stronger and more able to deal with challenges you will face in the future. At your darkest hour, turn away from the lie and turn toward those who will tell you the truth. <br>\r\n<br>\r\nIt’s true, I have absolutely no shame in accepting the fact that I personally have also suffered from the same devastating feeling. <br>\r\nI know how it feels to be hopeless or to feel like it’s over and there is no way that its ever going to be alright. <br>\r\nI was very lucky that I got in touch with someone, he helped me through it and today, I’m perfectly alright. <br>\r\n&nbsp;Ask yourself, if I can why can’t you? <br>\r\nTry to seek some professional help if symptoms and feelings exist. <br>\r\nJust realize that suicide is actually a permanent solution to a very temporary problem, please think before you leap! <br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n<br>"

		"description" : "Often questions like, \"Do you accept transgender people?\" are raised then and now. It's surprising how the society gives no second thought when it comes to classifying people. Being a transgender has not caused any harm to the society, which leaves us with no reason for not accepting them. &nbsp;<div>But unfortunately, not everyone can have a rational mindset. There are people in the society who ridicule other people who are different from them. As a result of which, many transgender people face harassment at different levels. They are looked down on and isolated from the culture. It is the sad truth of our society that whosoever stands out is always at a greater risk of being attacked. Transgender people come from all walks of life. They are parents, daughters, sons, co-workers, your neighbors, actors, or anybody. They are humans with the same ambition as yours, emotions for their family and friends, and equally talented and deserving as any other person of this world. So why should there be any discrimination against them? For years transgender people have struggled for their acceptance to the society and acknowledgement to their identity. However, with so little development with their acceptance there are still many individuals, teenagers and children who are afraid to come in light and accept themselves to be different from rest of the crowd. The truth is, the process of transition is not tough but the road to self-acceptance is. It is important to explore all avenues and also have stable and grounded emotions to commence the journey of transition.&nbsp;</div><div>But to achieve all this, transgender individuals require &nbsp;Equality,support and acceptance from the society. If someone who is trying to get comfortable in its own skin is considered being unethical or immoral then the people of this world need to evaluate their moral code.&nbsp;</div><div>Equality is deserved by each and every living being on this planet. And, fighting for greater equality for a particular section takes away nothing from us. We owe a lot more than acceptance to these individuals, and that is, a START.&nbsp;<span style=\"color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: q_serif, Georgia, Times, &quot;Times New Roman&quot;, serif; font-size: 15px; text-align: start;\">I'd&nbsp;</span><span style=\"color: rgb(69, 69, 69); font-size: 14px; font-family: gotham_lightregular;\">&nbsp;</span></div>"

These parents refrains themselves from sending their kids to school and teach their kids at home, however it seems fit.&nbsp;</div><div>The thing is, every child should have basic reasoning ability, imagination, and clear concept of things. How does it matters from where he/she gets it? Be it proper schooling or home schooling, the basic thing is a child should be ready to face life and have ability to make the most of it. The dream and ambition of a child should not be crushed under any circumstances.</div><div><br></div><div>There is no rule in India against homeschooling but it is not fully recognized as well. The RTE (Right to Education) law, does not recognize homeschooling. It is loosely written and does not cover the whole picture. Different lawmakers of different regions have their own views on homeschooling.&nbsp;</div><div>I think homeschooling should be regulated and recognized by the government. RTE should be revised in favor of homeschooling. <br>Instead of making every kid industry ready, let the parents decide how they want to raise their kids. Maybe a child's focus is not in calculus, but instead prefers painting, or language, or acting. Who knows, maybe a child's dream is to be a lorry driver and to travel places. But again it raises the social stigma of 'these are not the jobs for educated', which again raises the question of 'difference between educated and literate'.

But this toy turns out to be the\r\nultimate passion for a few in the thick of us. There is this fable about one in\r\nthe thick of those. &nbsp;There it goes ….<o:p></o:p></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The first interaction of her with the cube was magical,\r\nmight that she figured out why it was possibly known as the magical cube. She\r\nruminated it to be the most interesting piece of work to put one’s hands on! She\r\nfelt it to be so very alive in itself, heating up the hands, bolstering the\r\nzest of solving it, also, the enthusiasm she felt was over whelming.<o:p></o:p></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Going down the memory lane, the very day when she started\r\nsolving the cube, it was enormously frustrating, she had a tough time. Gosh!\r\nThat poor thing was thrown down the wall, for not being able to get solved.\r\nThere were these unseen connections she got to learn- that little cube was\r\ndrilling in copious enlightenment! - The most glorious moments in life are not\r\nthe so called days of the success but rather those days when out of dejection\r\nand despair we feel to rise in us the challenge to life, challenge to stand up-\r\nget that fervour out in the right direction and work on with heart &amp; soul!<o:p></o:p></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;While trying her hands\r\non Rubik’s cube she unsolved some abstruse philosophies. &nbsp;She metaphorically imitated the magical cube\r\nwith the magical life. That the wheel of events go on and on, at times you\r\nsolve the difficulties, at times it’s difficult to solve them. What matters\r\nmuch more is the expedition, than the destination. And the expedition ripens to\r\nbe alluring when we take up our very own passion, where we breathe in, what our\r\nsoul craves for!<o:p></o:p></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Thereby, when we do what we love, the seemingly impossible\r\nbecomes simply challenging, the labour becomes purposeful resistance, and the\r\ndifficult loses its edge and is trampled eventually by our progress. And so did\r\nhappen with her! She figured out the key to solve the magical cube! That her\r\nbest time of solving the Rubik’s cube turned out to be 45 sec. <o:p></o:p></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">Life is a marvel! And the time we own is minimal. Thus, the\r\nmost crucial thing is to enjoy it, to take up the ultimate passion, strive for\r\nit, possess that zeal to achieve it and keep on trying till our soul gets\r\nquenched! , as it is duly said by Sir David frost – <o:p></o:p></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">&nbsp;“Don’t aim for\r\nsuccess if you want it, just do what you love, believe in, and it will come\r\nnaturally”<o:p></o:p></p>\r\n\r\n<p class=\"MsoListParagraph\" style=\"text-indent:-18.0pt;mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1\"><!--[if !supportLists]-->-<span style=\"font-variant-numeric: normal; font-stretch: normal; font-size: 7pt; line-height: normal; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n</span><!--[endif]-->Master Hetal<o:p></o:p></p>"

		"description" : "<div>The pen is a sword and so is a pen a key to a blaze full of dreams and desires. If you go past the casual streets of any city, town or village in India, sadly there would be at least one person, be it in the form of a housemaid, gardener, mechanic, stall worker, etc, who has never been amongst the walls of a school. Education to these people is limited to knowing the basic maths of calculating timely household budgets or words enough to sign their names on a legal document. Over the years there has been an increasing need of educated youth, but as the policies on education rises, the population rises too and the ratio of uneducated people yet remains the same.</div><div><br></div><div>This arises as a major challenge because one of the main nuances for a developed country is to have a knowledgable and intelligent population. According to All Global Monotoring Report (GMR) released in 2014 by UNESCO, India has the largest population of illiterate adults with a population of 273 million. This is 37 percent of the world's total. It accounts for the fact that the very major issue of the prevailance of poverty gets its roots from illiterate backgrounds. It is also furnishing Child Labour and other atrocities. About 11 million of India's children even in modern times are being stolen of the right to learn because their parents have no money to finance their education. Others are simply dropping out of school because of poor performance or are physically/mentally unstable. Further, circumstances are causing them to enter beggery and dangerously many of them are even entering the inveterate circle of drugs. These children are unable to be a part of the legitimate society that India should be holding in it in order to combat the modern phase. In turn, we are advancing at lesser pace compared to how fast we should be moving.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>As far as society and gender biasing is concerned, girls are still a major part of the uneducated globe with them constituting about 50 percent of the circle. This statistics includes all adults and younger ages. These girls are getting married off and are being made to set households. Female foeticide still prevails because our society has still not learnt the importance of equality of genders. A major role in raising the pride of a nation can be made by this population as economical and scientific advancements comes as a subject to education of all its minor population.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>If the scenario continues, unemployment will become the devil troubling the youth. Even if there is employment, they will be the ones with lower incomes and with lower qualities of jobs. Illiteracy limits access to lifelong learning, professional development and ability to understand necessary information.</div><div><br></div><div>The government of the county has been influential in providing free education in most of the districts along with free meals in order to promote education, but sadly the ardent need for money in the family is not making some observable change. The Indian government launched the Right to Education act in August 2009, which describes the modalities of free and compulsary education for children 6 and 14 in India. Others are still under the regard of sending their girls to school. The condition of the government schools moreover is not in its best. Many schools still do not have proper infrastructure, and nor do they provide enough resources to be able to think outside of their dimly lit globe. 92 percent of government schools are yet to implement the RTE act. Unqualified teachers have also been on the prowl as it was discovered in Bihar in 2013 that a lot of the teaching staff was not rightfully qualified and others had simply paid for a job. Corruption at a level like this is not only demarking the future of billions of children of India, but also being able to abstrain them from dreaming. This suggests that by 2025, India will not be able to serve its population with proper jobs as jobs only grow with education and at an age like this, a person without a job irrespective of gender is not counted for! &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Education in literary sense does not only take into notice the being able to read and write notation, but it also introduces your persona, mental thinking and other correlated aspects to the worldly affairs. It introduces expressions, beliefs and attainment of strength required by the mighty individual who looks forward to achieve. Therefore, in order to grow it is important that the notion is discussed with outmost care and importance. India needs education, and the strive for it still continues.</div><div><br></div><div>Let's hope for a better and educated world. Let's hope for a better and educated youth. Let's hope for a better and educated elders. Let's hope for a better and educated India.&nbsp;</div>"

No matter how short the distance, travelling has an enormous power to drag you into a whirlpool of emotions. One second it feels like leaving everything behind, feeling liberated to the core; the next moment it feels like heading towards a strange and cold land, a tinge of sadness creeping inside you. The people you come across on roads have different stories to tell you. The woman carrying her baby in her arms and logs over her head tells she must be heading to light a fire, household chores must be running through her mind. The baby in her arms would be eager to reach home to quickly get into playing with the dust. The man on the shop must be tired of selling only to know he hadn't made enough for the day. A hope for a better tomorrow must be the driving force for him to work hard everyday. The truck drivers passing us by have a whole different story to tell. Days have passed and they haven't seen the doors of their homes. The night keeps them busy but the day would remind them of the hustle going on in their houses. They too want to go home. Different people, different struggle, different stories. And here I am sitting in my comfortable seat, in an air conditioned vehicle wandering why certain people leave, why certain people don't live up to their words when some people still struggle for the food on their table. This leaves me with mixed emotions. I am sad for them, I hope they reach their homes and have ample food on their table everyday. On the other hand I am grateful for the life I am given and to the people who still are a part of my life. Hadn't I seen those people, I would have not known their stories; Hadn't I fathomed their struggle, I would have not felt empathetic; Hadn't I travelled, I would still be engrossed in self pity. I guess that's the astounding power of travelling, you'll never go back to being the same person you were before travelling.

It can be your best friend and your worst enemy at the same time. A certain song can bring out some very specific memories. Maybe you wanted to forget those, maybe not. But now you are enriched with those memories. You listen to the song, you start to recollect missing pieces of your life.

Then, the situation improved and football as well as few other sports gained recognition and fame in and around UK. But the real impact came in the 21st century when a certain Andy Murray started hitting strides in the world of lawn tennis. Although, he was from Scotland yet, he was being seen as someone who would make a name not only for himself but also for the country though the road ahead was not so easy as he had to face a lot of difficulty in rising up the rankings. But, in 2016, Murray showed that he had that extra bit of inspiration and will to go that extra mile and claim the top ranking in Men's Singles division of Lawn Tennis. He had worked very hard to be in this position and would leave no stone unturned in sitting at this position for a long time.<br><br>For the past 7-8 years, Men's tennis was ruled by the Big Four viz., Federer, Nadal, Djokovic &amp; Murray. Federer and Nadal had been there for a long time and hence, had started to show signs of fatigue and age. This made way for Djokovic to rise up the rankings and ultimately grab the top position from Federer back in 2011, although he did slip up but it was only for a short period of time and he again returned to the top. But, for Murray, it was a case of so near yet so far. He could not make it to the top in spite of Federer and Nadal being down with injury and age-related issue leading to a dip in fitness. He came close to it yet couldn't achieve it but in 2016, Murray finally proved everyone wrong and did what he had been destined to achieve somewhere down the line. This, indeed, was a spectacular year for the British player as he had worked tremendously hard on his fitness as well as mental regime.<br><br>Starting with Australian Open, he could not overcome the challenge of Djokovic and had to settle for the runner's up title. The same story repeated at the French Open where he fell short against Djokovic once again. But, at Wimbledon, he showed to the world that it is quite difficult to beat him at his home and registered a win there and also went on to win the Gold Medal at Rio Olympics, 2016. After this, he went on to win two Masters Titles at Shanghai &amp; Paris and lastly, the season ending World Tour Finals too. This win gave the world a message that Murray had finally overcome his mental toughness and is ready to rule the world of tennis.<br>"

We are brought up in a very sophisticated manner, taught in good schools, given invaluable lessons of life, allowed to go abroad and do higher studies, and finally what happens is, we are married to someone and then the rest of our life is spent in serving and adhering to in-laws and their orders away from home We leave our home and the people that were a big part of our upbringing and move to a new house, a new neighborhood, a new society, completely devoid of any kind of&nbsp; support. We have to adjust and adjust and keep adjusting for the rest of our lives. We aren't allowed to speak in between the elders nor are we allowed to argue with our in-laws. Our views are not considered when taking some important decisions. It's like we exist but only in a materialistic way.<br><br>But people don't see our sacrifices. We, girls, do a lot for our in-laws. We treat them as our own parents, even though we are not related to them by blood. We consider their houses as ours, a home away from home. We adjust in an unknown place without speaking a word. We respect and value their traditions and culture. We care for them like our parents and siblings. We leave the comfort of our homes. We change ourselves for them. We don't get to talk to our parents for days, but still we remain silent. We are entitled to all the rights what boys get.<br><br>But what do we get in return for all these favors or sacrifices? We still have to bring dowry after marriage. We are still not allowed to work even after having very good qualifications. We still have to follow certain dressing sense. We are still being sexually assaulted by our in-laws. We get beaten for not adhering to the orders of in-laws or if we argue with them. And all these are done in the present scenario where we boast of being very open-minded and support women-empowerment.<br><br>Why don't these rules/restrictions apply for the son-in laws? Why is it that the son-in-laws don't have to face such problems when they come to our home? Why is it that the son-in-laws can freely talk to our parents and also argue with them if need be?

		"description" : "Teenage pregnancy is a pregnancy in females at the age of 13-19 years. It has become a major concern in many leading countries. It is something that is affecting over a million teens worldwide. It is therefore very important to find the root cause of this issue. The cause of teenage pregnancy is not solely the fault of the individuals involved. There is a heap pf other causes that lead to this situation.<div>&nbsp;The major element being the ignorance of parents/guardians towards educating their children about sex and the consequences that come with it. Parents usually shun their children's curiosity to learn or know about sex/sexual activities. According to them, ethics direct to keep such things away from children until they reach a certain age. Sadly,if curiosity is not cultivated properly,drifts to other implicit sources( friends,images,and the internet) to quench its thirst for knowledge. Such curiosities, unfortunately, end up having adverse impacts on both the family and the life of the teenager.&nbsp;</div><div>According to the statistics, 85% of the pregnancies are unplanned. Teenager's willingness to experiment is the major cause for an unplanned pregnancy. There are also many other reasons on the individual part. For instance, the urge to participate in 'cool/fun activities' like drinking,smoking,drugs largely influence &nbsp;this social matter. During adolescence, teens are hugely influenced by the social media, movies, and of course, their peers. They blindly follow the herd and do not want to be left out. Little that the teens realize, the never-ending chain of problems that they unknowingly welcome into their lives.&nbsp;</div><div>Other than the numerous health problems that become a part of a teen's life, not being able to continue with their studies becomes one of the long-term implications. The teens are suddenly loaded with responsibilities they were not prepared for and well surely, cannot escape from either.&nbsp;</div><div>It is very important that the teens are given adequate information about their pregnancy options before they make a decision. Parent's support make a huge difference in situation like this. However, the parents go through a wide range of emotions, from shock and disappointment to anxiety and worry about the future of the newborn and its mother. How bad the situation be, parents should not leave kids alone as they would need them more than ever.&nbsp;</div><div>To sum it up, teen pregnancy is an alarming issue that needs to be prevented as much it can be. Sex should not be made, 'a-cannot-be discussed' topic, a taboo. Children should not be protected from sex talks or subjected to ignorance, rather be allowed to openly talk about it. Don't they say that prevention is better than the cure?! &nbsp;It is better to talk about it instead of making your children have misconceptions and wrong ideas about something that can have negative outcomes in the future.&nbsp;</div><div>Now it's up to you, either acknowledge them, or turn them a blind eye!<br><span style=\"color: rgb(69, 69, 69); font-size: 14px; font-family: gotham_lightregular;\"><br></span><span style=\"color: rgb(69, 69, 69); font-size: 14px; font-family: gotham_lightregular;\"><br></span></div>"

The dust particles, the more minute they get, the more harm they cause, and tallying recent reports it has been observed that such matter has had an effective increase over the years. It directly results in the changing of various earthly phenomenons such as that of ozone layer depletion or the disturbances in the hydrological cycle.

After Using His Nobel Prize Acceptance Speech To Justify The Paradoxical Concept Of “just War,” Obama Went On To Carry Out Relentless Bombing Campaigns In 7 Muslim Nations Over The Course Of His Presidency – All Of Which Are Still In Effect Today. Obama’s Affinity For Bombs Seems To Know No Bounds As The Last Year Of His Presidency – 2016 – Saw A Significant Increase In Bombs Dropped Compared To Previous Years Of His Administration.</p><p align=\"left\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0px; Padding: 0px; Border: 0px; Font-size: 16px; Vertical-align: Baseline; Color: Rgb(0, 0, 0); Font-family: Lato, Sans-serif; Background-color: Rgb(238, 238, 238);\">According To&nbsp;<a href=\"http://blogs.cfr.org/zenko/2017/01/05/bombs-dropped-in-2016/\" style=\"margin: 0px; Padding: 0px; Border: 0px; Vertical-align: Baseline; Font-weight: 700; Transition: Color 0.3s; Color: Rgb(205, 23, 19);\">an Analysis Of Military Data</a>, The US Dropped A Total Of 26,171 Bombs In 2016 – 3,027 More Than In 2015. The Analysis, Carried Out By The Globalist-run Council On Foreign Relations (CFR), Showed That A Majority Of Those Bombs Were Dropped In Iraq (12,095) And In Syria (12,192). However, Even The CFR Admits That Number Is Likely Much Higher As Air-strikes Can Often Involve Multiple Bombs. Most Of These Bombs Were Dropped As Part Of The US-led Coalition To Fight Against The Islamic State In An Attempt “to Reduce The Area Controlled By The Terrorist Organization.” However, The US’ Bombing Of ISIS Targets&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2015/08/07/430151358/after-a-year-of-bombing-isis-u-s-campaign-shows-just-limited-gains\" style=\"margin: 0px; Padding: 0px; Border: 0px; Vertical-align: Baseline; Font-weight: 700; Transition: Color 0.3s; Color: Rgb(205, 23, 19);\">has Been Incredibly Ineffective</a>. Before Russia Joined The Conflict, The US Bombing Campaign Allowed ISIS To Nearly Triple Their Territory, Accomplishing The Literal Opposite Of The Campaign’s Alleged Goal. In Addition To Its Ineffectiveness, The Effects Of These Bombing Campaigns Will Be Felt For Years To Come, Long After Any Current Conflict Ends. Thanks To Years Of US Military Intervention In Iraq, Desertification Has Escalated Dramatically, As US Military Operations Have Devastated Both Key Infrastructure And The Natural Environment.

In Afghanistan, 1,337 Bombs Were Dropped, Up From 947 In 2015. Libya, Another Country In Chaos, Thanks To US Intervention, Was Bombed Nearly 500 Times. In Addition, The US’ Bombing Campaign In Yemen Continued Throughout The Year Despite The Unbelievable Suffering Taking Place There, Thanks To The US-supported Saudi-led Conflict. The US, Which Is Not At War With Yemen, Bombed The Nation 34 Times, Down From 58 In 2015.

The Countries That Received The Fewest Bombs Were Somalia (14) And Pakistan (3).</p><p align=\"left\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0px; Padding: 0px; Border: 0px; Font-size: 16px; Vertical-align: Baseline; Color: Rgb(0, 0, 0); Font-family: Lato, Sans-serif; Background-color: Rgb(238, 238, 238);\">Of Course, Obama Has Done Much More To Benefit The Perpetual War Status Quo Aside From His Gratuitous Use Of Bombs. A Year After Obama Took Office, US Weapons Sales To Foreign Powers Jumped Threefold Up To&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/27/world/middleeast/us-foreign-arms-sales-reach-66-3-billion-in-2011.html\" style=\"margin: 0px; Padding: 0px; Border: 0px; Vertical-align: Baseline; Font-weight: 700; Transition: Color 0.3s; Color: Rgb(205, 23, 19);\">over $66 Billion</a>. By The End Of Obama’s First Term, The US Accounted For&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.truth-out.org/opinion/item/35332-president-obama-s-lesser-known-legacy-arms-dealer-in-chief\" style=\"margin: 0px; Padding: 0px; Border: 0px; Vertical-align: Baseline; Font-weight: 700; Transition: Color 0.3s; Color: Rgb(205, 23, 19);\">more Than 77%</a>&nbsp;of The World’s Arms Trade. As President, Obama Also Brokered Record-breaking Arms Deals, Such As When He Sold&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-saudi-security-idUSKCN11D2JQ\" style=\"margin: 0px; Padding: 0px; Border: 0px; Vertical-align: Baseline; Font-weight: 700; Transition: Color 0.3s; Color: Rgb(205, 23, 19);\">more Than $115 Billion</a>&nbsp;in Weapons To Saudi Arabia – One Of The Countries Confirmed To Fund ISIS And Other Terrorist Groups In The Middle East. Despite His Role In Weaponizing The Planet And In Dropping Hundreds Of Thousands Of Bombs, Obama Still Has Yet To Face The Opposition That His Predecessor George W. Bush Once Faced From The Anti-war Left. Though Obama’s Vastly Better PR And Media Coverage Is Partially Responsible, It Seems That The Past 8 Years Has Seen Much Of What Was Once The Anti-war Left Look The Other Way Because A Democrat Is In The White House. Perhaps They Still Are Waiting For Obama To Finally Deliver On His Nebulous Campaign Promises Of “hope” And “change” Even Though He Has Less Than Two Weeks Still In Office. However, At Some Point, They Will Have To Admit That Obama, Like Almost All Presidents Before Him, Serves The Interest Of The Military-industrial “deep State,” Not The American People.</p><p style=\"margin-bottom: 0px; Padding: 0px; Border: 0px; Font-size: 16px; Vertical-align: Baseline; Color: Rgb(0, 0, 0); Font-family: Lato, Sans-serif; Background-color: Rgb(238, 238, 238);\"><i style=\"margin: 0px; Padding: 0px; Border: 0px; Vertical-align: Baseline;\">What Are Your Thoughts?</i>&nbsp;<b style=\"margin: 0px; Padding: 0px; Border: 0px; Vertical-align: Baseline;\">Please Comment Below And Share This News!</b></p><span style=\"margin: 0px; Padding: 0px; Border-width: 0px; Border-style: Initial; Border-color: Initial; Font-size: 16px; Vertical-align: Baseline; Color: Rgb(0, 0, 0); Font-family: Lato, Sans-serif; Text-align: Left; Background-color: Rgb(238, 238, 238);\"><br><br><br></span>"

We’ve already seen lifelines being extended to Gautam Gambhir and Parthiv Patel. Patel was brought back from a eight-year hiatus while Gambhir was given an unexpected recall when the doors seemed to be tightly shut on his international career.<br>So on the face of it, the return of Yuvraj Singh to the ODI team-he also reclaims his place in the T20 squad after having appeared last in the World T20 semifinal last March-could just be looked at as a continuation of their selection policy.<br>The 35-year-old hasn’t been in India’s ODI plans for more than three years now. And the three-match series against England is supposed to be when India usher in a new dawn under a new captain in Virat Kohli. But at least in Yuvraj, the selectors seemed to have thought it prudent to bring back an old don.<br>The 2019 World Cup is just over two years away now. And India have only 55 matches before their opening game.<br>Their preparation starts now. With Kohli now at the helm, this is when they build a team that would be ready to challenge for the trophy in England. So are the selectors actually looking at Yuvraj, who will officially be 37 by then, as a serious part of their World Cup plans? Or is it just a short-gap acknowledgment of his recent performances in domestic cricket which could lead to a fitting farewell at the Champions Trophy?<br>Either way, there are questions that beg to be answered. Yuvraj comes back at a time the Indian middle-order is still not settled. It’s a fickle batting line-up with no clear takers for positions from No.4-No.6.<br>Let’s say MS Dhoni sticks to the No.4 spot that he seemed keen on occupying during the series win over New Zealand in October. Kedar Jadhav was the biggest takeaway for India against the Kiwis, both with bat and ball, which should make him a certain starter at No.6 for now.<br>That leaves only the No.5 spot up for grabs. So Yuvraj is likely then to compete for a place in the XI with Manish Pandey and Ajinkya Rahane. Yuvraj has the experience and he has the big shots. Though not as much of a high-flyer as in his early days, he still remains a safe fielder. And he can always chip in with his agonizingly slow left-arm spin.<br>It’s understandable then that the selectors are desperate for Yuvraj to click. Not to forget, that India’s bane over the last year or so in 50-over cricket has been the lack of a designated finisher. It’s safe to say that in a scenario where the team needs 120 off the last 12 overs, you’d any day pick Yuvraj over a Pandey or a Rahane. Hardik Pandya is billed to be the gung-ho, boundary-clearing ‘finisher’ but he’s still too raw and unproven at this level. Jadhav has played a few audacious cameos, but he still doesn’t convince you to do so in a high-pressure situation. Then there’s also the question of if not Yuvraj then who, in terms of the options available outside the squad. You look around the circuit and few names prop up instantaneously for you to be outraged by his inclusion. But does Yuvraj have the age and the fitness for the selectors to be making a two-year investment in him? For the record, the punt on Gambhir was a failed move. But you can always get away with a gamble of that sort in Test cricket, considering it’s a short-term one. You give someone a series or maybe two to see if they can cut the mustard and then just give up on it. It doesn’t really unsettle a team in the long-run.<br>But if Yuvraj wastes his three opportunities against England like Gambhir did, then it would mean three missed opportunities for Pandey, Rahane or both to cement their place in the team and as a result settle the middle-order. Keeping in mind the World Cup that is. Ironically, the axe dropped on Yuvraj’s ODI career the last time around when India were just building their team for the 2015 World Cup Down Under. He had crossed fifty once in the previous 19 matches, averaging 18.53. Mitchell Johnson had exposed a weakness in the left-hander against the short-ball that pretty much laid Yuvraj to waste. One failure at Johannesburg on the truncated tour to South Africa in late 2013 was enough to convince Prasad’s predecessors that it was time to move on. Like with Patel and Gambhir, Yuvraj’s recall was hailed by Prasad as just reward for a stellar domestic season. The numbers are impressive of course. He did after all score 672 runs at 84 in 5 Ranji Trophy matches for Punjab. And Prasad didn’t stick to just throwing up the numbers in trying to justify his committee’s bold move.<br>“We should appreciate the way Yuvraj Singh has played in domestic cricket. All these days we thought he hasn’t played long innings. But he has scored a double-hundred. He scored 180 on the Lahli wicket,” he said.<br>At the moment, it looks more like they’re content with giving the veteran a chance and seeing how it goes with the hope of course that it doesn’t go the Gambhir way.<br>ODI squad: KL Rahul, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli (capt), MS Dhoni, Manish Pandey, Kedar Jadhav, Yuvraj Singh, Ajinkya Rahane, Hardik Pandya, R Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, Amit Mishra, Jasprit Bumrah, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Umesh Yadav.<br>T20I squad: KL Rahul, Mandeep Singh, Virat Kohli (capt), MS Dhoni (wk), Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina, Rishabh Pant (wk), Hardik Pandya, R Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, Yuzvendra Chahal, Manish Pandey, Jasprit Bumrah, Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Ashish Nehra.</p></div>"

Let's start with some details about the program namely EWS/DG scheme. I went to a slum area to make people aware of the scheme that delhi government had started for little kids from economically weaker sections and disabled group. They were to be provided free school education , school dress and required books in the schools made on the plots of DDA. I went there just a day before the last day of registration and i was surprised to notice that none of the people were informed about it, not even ill-informed. And they were the target audience. Our team surveyed in 14 areas and same was the case everywhere. Delhi government is boasting about this scheme and common people unaware of these facts just believe what they say. According to our estimates not even 20% of the targets were aware of this scheme. When i met them and i old them that their kids can get all these facilities for free they were quite happy but here comes the next situation. Most of them were not having the complete set of documents required for registration. Of 26 families that i surveyed, only 2 had all the papers needed. And interesting part is that they were not guilty for this. They were put into such a situation by our government officials. Let me put a brief conversation here that was going around:<div>Me:- Why don't you people go to you nearest SDM office or Tehsildar and apply for these documents?</div><div>They:- Sir, we have been there for several times but, they demand a hefty pay for any document that we apply for like 300-400 rupees and this is our payment of 2 or 3 days.</div><div>It means if they have to get any document from these offices, their family will have to sleep without food for 2-3 days.</div><div>So, the question here is that is government equipped enough to start a program and then</div><div>accomplish it all by their own or are there some factors that they are missing?

A good structure also improves health, keeping your bones healthy and wear free for longer times.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Being socially apt is as important as is other jobs. Dancing gets you closer to it. The happier you get, the more you mix up, and the more you rejoice. Encourage dance and spread the words so that maybe it turns up really fruitful for the people who really needed the therapy. A healthier and happier society is the goal, and dancing the way through is the key to the goal.</div>"

		"title" : "Is contemporary Bollywood cinema challenging gender stereotypes ",
		"description" : "<div><br></div><div>Gender stereotyping is a major issue and it is often that we rely on mainstream media to bring about changes in the country because of their influential prototype. In a world today, with the women awaking stronger than ever, gender stereotyping has been seen as a bigoted move and relieving the society of ideas like these is a major and widely approved challenge.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Bollywood on a whole is one of the most successful and widely accepted industry the country has owned. It influences a wider crowd and has the potential of leaving it with lessons that no one else can explicably instil. Typically Bollywood was all about romances, action and drama that had sought to entertain the crowd with its peppiness. But recent times has indeed gotten forth the era of documenting political and social issues and has been asking the society to imply with them. Gender biasing in Bollywood is becoming highly restricted, and the idea of what a normal heroine used to be is shattering with every passing project that is presented to the society.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Earlier, not so long ago, all of us remember what position the male actor held in the movie, with the whole concept of the film revolving around his fantasies, fortunes and losses. The heroine however, was a clear cut cliche of the typically ideal girl who held the role of the hero's interest. This lady was not depicted as an independent figure who owned herself. Recently the success of women centric films have come to show us that indeed Bollywood has moved on from the concept and has started to write down females with dreams and flaws. The women are being seen as humanly figures, some with insecurities, others that are socially challenged, and others with dreams. This rationalisation in the story lines is indeed promoting empowerment and is holding its hand to bringing about changes in the traditional mindsets of society.</div><div><br></div><div>The cinemas, apart from the fiction, is now having a hand in the composition of real life stories which play a bigger role in influencing the society. Many stories related to the driving forces of life of a women under her protectiveness are being showcased and are revealing out the various types of securities and insecurities a woman faces. The wider part of the audience is too uplifting the cause of the direction of such films and their level of appreciation is indeed commendable.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>The actors as of now have also taken a hand in breaking of stereotypes. Just not in reel life, but many ones in real life have also taken to promoting empowerment and breaking the notion of what a woman is meant for. They have been focusing on delivering speeches and because of the popularity have been influencing everyone. They have moved on from only acting side roles to directing and producing the films, and are now being paid higher depending on their level of work.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Thereby as we see, small changes are being brought up one at a time. As the cinema challenges the society to care for the status of women, it also bring hopes to sought equality amongst the citizens. It is this hope that could lead us forward and this hope that becomes our staircase to social justice.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div>"

		"title" : "10  LESSONS  TO  TAKE  FROM  SCHOOL  TO  COLLEGE",
		"description" : "<div>DEAR FRIEND, YOU ARE YOUR OWN PARENT NOW</div><div>I bet you say to yourself, 'Hey, I am so confused with life, I need some advice ' or 'Professor, I don't have a career choice yet...' or 'Mom, Should &nbsp;I be a part of this cultural event?' or 'Dad, Is this dance my calling?' . In college, do you constantly call up your parents or professors for advice and always get an unsatisfactory response or feel that it's not enough. (SIGH) BUT....Congratulations, my friend, you have entered a world that treats you as an adult (apart from the customary morality speeches). Your well-wishers now will see you as a complete Mister or Missus, and given the generation gap they are perfectly correct for there is not much they can do now! College is when you come out of your little, frail and fragile cottage and enter the high-raised and emotionless offices. No one will identify abilities for you. Opportunities will not come to you served on a platter. Any workshop, competition or an idea you stumble on, do not look on your side for approval...mommy and daddy won't be right there. Instead you need to look back, for a nod and some emotional assurance only! So....it's the time you become your own parent. Thus making you capable in decision making which will help you a lot ahead in you especially professional life.</div><div><br></div><div>2. &nbsp;DEAR FRIEND, TIME TO SAY YES TO EVERYTHING&nbsp;</div><div>Even if you're the Mayan Calendar with all your dates and life documented and planned, you do not know where your career and life take you. So if any opportunity, person, responsibility, job, workshop, advertisement etc come your way... do not think twice about taking part. SAY YES! &nbsp;It can take you to mountains, and down alleys and long winding pavements that you couldn't have imagined. Put yourself in the most uncomfortable positions if you have to for you will create stories to remember. Moreover it doesn’t hurt to experiment while in college coz after that you will not get chances to explore different sides of yourself. You will make mistakes you'll laugh at! If you have the annoying 'emergency break' tendency to pull the plug and no try something new, then you will remain in school. Is there a competition coming up?? GO. Is there an advertisement for this cool coding conference?? GO. See someone interesting in the bus? TALK!...Off with the emergency break....</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>3. It's OK</div><div>It's OK to feel whatever you feel and not know where you are going. Doubt, low confidence, self doubt, boredom, lust, confusion....Don't be hard o yourself....This is life, the climax is meant to be a suspense. Would AXN's Sherlock be fun if you knew the FINAL SCENE? Moreover these are the years where you can find the true you and no one achieved anything in the first try without making mistakes.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>4. BOARD MARKS DO NOT MATTER</div><div>This is one thing you will get to know as soon as you reach college and will make most of you happy. Are you disheartened with a 60% or are you super-complacent with a 96% ? Do not be. It's ONLY your ticket into the world of college and not your master stroke achievement. Your game has just started .No one made it big in life with the perfect board marks. Throw your petty report card into the non-recyclable trash can....it is not something that defines you for life! Venture out! Throw more colors and spices to the report card of life.</div><div><br></div><div>5. &nbsp;CHOOSE COMPANY WISELY</div><div>College is where you make a life for yourself. Life love, friendships can make you or break you. You start making choices between booze or snooze, all-nighters or daily study, wrong and right...It is an impressionable age and you will not know how the environment of the people around seeps into you. Judgments people wisely and do not let them influence you! Or don’t crumble under peer pressure if you feel something is not right for you say NO, it won’t ruin your friendship and if it does and those people weren’t your friends at all.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>6. 5 SECOND RULE</div><div>If you are doubtful in any situation about 'To be or not to be' or 'To enroll or not enroll myself' or 'Talk to her or not talk to her'....if you marry the thought with an action within 5 second then, congrats the thought is still alive. Send yourself a text or write on your hand or even get up to enroll or talk! Since you have decided to say YES to everything, this rule will give you all the courage to let go off your demons, &nbsp;baggage and inhibitions for those seconds. After that happens, you go with the flow soldier!</div><div><br></div><div>7.MASTER A NEW SKILL</div><div>Are you someone who doesn't have a particular hobby? Do you think you're too busy or too old now that you are a bachelor of a course?. If you are 18, fat, lazy or inflexible but have always wanted to do ballet....do not stop. You can do whatever you want hence add a new fresh skill to your kitty. It is something that plugs the boredom out of your college life and studies. Trust me, the time you spend on it will repay you with self discoveries and a unique skill set. And if you don’t try something new what the difference coming to college has even made, changes and experiments are necessary my friend to keep the thrill in life.</div><div><br></div><div>8.KEEP OLD SKILLS ALIVE</div><div>Skill...it's a nice little word. It keeps your tongue rolling and soul alive. You were a person in school you did a lot of singing , painting or tennis. Now in college, you call yourself 'old', you think, 'Hey, time to let go...I am too busy'. You are a WRONG and you are committing gross murder. Murder, of that part of your brain that keep you creative and colorful! Do not give into the monotony of studies and career, so to say. Keep the 'lalaasss' and 'hooolas' alive! A plus point of these skills can be they can be a great ice breaker especially when you are new in the college and looking for some friends having the same skills like singing or playing an instrument. Thus our OLD skills help in building NEW relationships.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>9.DON'T TRY TO DECORATE A RESUME</div><div>Sigh, the world and the student community is plagued by numbers. School life you are told that you should be a good student. You slowly tick through time trying to fill your report with impressive yet meaningless numbers. In college, you are told that 'CGPA is life' and your résumé has to be sparkling and alluring. Your résumé , my friend, does not have to be Nicole Kidman. Your résumé is prey to the 'unrealistic beauty standards' of this monotonous world, and do not get blinded by them! Take up jobs, participate in workshops etc. for your sake, not to paint your résumé for some random company to judge you by. You should also listen to your inner self and do things which you find interesting instead of just trying to live by the standards set by others.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>1O.CREATE MEMORIES</div><div>Memories create funny conversations, funny conversations keeps you younger. And young is good! You are a little restricted in school for you are a little puppy. In college, it's time you let yourself free and make full use of the freedom. if anything goes right, left or wrong..tell yourself that you are creating memories for a hearty laugh in the future, sitting by the fireplace fifty years from now with your glass of wine, family and dog. So wag your tails and seize the world by your paws!&nbsp;</div><div><br></div>"

But, drug resistant to drugs areas common these days. so, looking toward nature for help can be a good idea. As the number of cases of mind related problems are increasing, it is becoming more important for us to have a good information on how we can protect our-self from mind and health related problems (or at least can minimize their effect) and in</div><div>some case we can even undo the health of affected peoples using some \"short tricks\". All we have to do is, just take care of the things we are taking as input and nature has abundance of items that can help us and one among them is taking Vitamin C. It is like the king of all the vitamins when it comes to improve our mental state.</div><div>Its benefits are:-</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-produces Neurotransmitters, which acts as a transmitter in between the neurons(our brain 100 billion neurons approx).</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Neurons control our moods, addiction, sleep, ability to focus, concentrate and remember(so you can imagine its importance).</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-Improves IQ, memory and other mental function.</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-Protect against age related problems like alzheimer's diseases, dementia and strokes.</div><div>But we have to take it in a limited quantity as \"excess of every thing is bad, however better it is!\". According to USDA, for men it is 75 mg per day for women and 90 mg for men and its important sources are:-</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Fruits - Citrus fruits, mango, papaya,pineapple,watermelon.</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Vegetables- Sweet and white potato, tomato, cauliflower and broccoli.</div><div>Next is, Vitamin D. And interesting thing about this vitamin is that for this, we don't have to invest money. All we have to do is just sit somewhere in a bright Sunshine and your skin will take care of rest of the things.It is proved by various scientist that</div><div>it is protective against cancer, diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure and counting still goes. The usual rule is “20 minutes of sun twice a week” on a large surface area of your body, such as arms or legs, for adequate vitamin D formation.</div><div>One more is Vitamin B. Actually this is not one vitamin but a family of vitamins that have similar structures with some element being added or subtracted in place of some another element in order to produce a new member. And important members of this family are B6,B9(folic acid), and B12.&nbsp;</div><div>They can improve energy levels and increase your tolerance to stress.The B vitamins can reduce brain aging, banish depression, and &nbsp;can even help you live longer!</div><div>An important role of B vitamins for brain heath is in the production of the neurotransmitters serotonin, dopamine, and GABA. If you’re deficient in serotonin, you may suffer from anxiety, insomnia, low self-esteem, negative thoughts and SAD (seasonal affective disorder).Without adequate GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), you may find yourself easily stressed, overstimulated and overwhelmed.</div><div>Dopamine helps you get focused. Source of these vitamins:-</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-Folic acid can be found in green leafy vegetables, legumes(pulses except arhar(tur)), fruit, eggs, and organ meats.</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-The best food sources of vitamin B-6 are fish, poultry, bananas, carrots, spinach, peas, and potatoes.</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;-Vitamin B-12 can be found in all animal products — meat, fish, eggs, and dairy.&nbsp;</div><div>So, keep a track of these things and you will be less prone to mind related diseases.

Most commonly they end up doing MBA, startups, family business, sales and marketing, government employees, freelancers and what not.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then why do they pursue engineering and study 40 subjects, hundreds of laboratory experiments,24 Internal Exams, 3 Mini projects, tons seminars and a final year project in their 4 years of engineering life. If people start deciding their area of interest in engineering prior enrolling into engineering we will definitely see a rise in graduates in their respective field for career going up by almost 50-70%.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; So guys let's at least change this engineering mania and guide our next generation to pursue their dreams and explore the world as it is and study the various culture and many more things that are spread across the land filled area on the globe.</div><div><br></div><div>Please Do Leave A Comment</div>"

		"description" : "Now, for all those who are not familiar with K-Pop, here's a brief introduction: K-pop is Korean Pop music. <br><br>For those who are familiar with K-Pop or just Korean music in general, this article will probably make more sense and will be more entertaining. Although it might be an interesting experience for the newcomers too.<br><br>Anyways, with the Billboard Music Awards coming up, all the nominated artists are gearing up and the fans are hoping for a win for their favorite artist. While there's a battle going on between famous artists like Justin Bieber, The Chainsmokers and others, this Korean boy group called Bangtan Boys or more commonly known as BTS, has climbed their way up to the list of artists nominated for the Top Social Artist Award. <br><br>Before anything else, a little bit about BTS:<br><br>Bangtan Boys, also known as BTS, is a seven member South Korean group that was formed in 2013 under BigHit Entertainment. The Leader, Rap Monster, along with two other members of the group, J-Hope and Suga, are the rappers of the group and members Jin, Jimin, V and Jungkook make up the vocal team. But that's not all. While all of them dance quite fantastically, members J-Hope, Jimin and Jungkook contribute a lot to their choreography.<br><br>The Bangtan Boys started out as a hip-hop group but through the years, they have explored and experimented with other genres as well. Aside from their sick music, the lyrics of their songs are one of the main reasons for their ever-growing fan following. They write about what the youth of this generation is going through. From relationships to hard times in one's life, BTS beautifully delivers the truth without sugar coating anything. And that's why the fans relate to their songs so much.<br><br>Their fandom which is named A.R.M.Y. went crazy when they found out that BTS was nominated for BBMAs. This is a big deal for a lot of reasons. A few of them are:<br><br>1. BTS is the first ever K-pop group and the second Korean artist after Psy to be nominated for BBMAs.<br><br>2. BTS is a fairly new K-Pop group in the Korean music industry as compared to other senior groups since it has only been 4 years since the group was formed.<br><br>The fans are eagerly waiting for the voting to start on May 1 so that they can get BTS the win they deserve. <br><br>Being a BTS fan myself, if they do win (and I hope they do), I think it is going be a great accomplishment both for the fans and for BTS because despite knowing that they have a great fan following internationally and winning several Korean music awards, winning an award like the Billboard Award just establishes the fact that they are being acknowledged as great artists internationally too.<br><br>So, for those open to new music and new experiences, do check out BTS' Work. And for those who're already familiar with BTS, don't forget that voting starts from 1st May and let's do our best to get BTS their first Billboard Award. Fighting!<br><br>"

Rajamouli has shown perfection in presenting each frame of the film. Bahubali-2 &nbsp;comes off as too much sound and fury signifying little. The movie is expected to cross the &nbsp;collection if it's first part. The movie is likely to reach rs 1000 crre box office record. Tough the audience enjoyed the second part enormously. The movie has released in over 8000 screens worldwide all over today. The movie gets a 4.5 stars rating. Overall the movie is a complete pack of attraction.
