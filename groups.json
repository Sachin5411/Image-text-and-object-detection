		"description" : "<p>Tanzania Kilimanjaro is one of the highest altitude trek and this is the reason that it is one of the most popular one. You can simply walk up, you need no ropes or any special climbing equipment for climbing it. That doesn’t mean it is so simple rather this fact makes the Tanzania Kilimanjaro climb more exciting and demanding adventure.</p><p>This climb is simpler than other climb on other mountains. You may not require buddle of experiences, but you will need some essential things for this trek. Altitude is the main problem as the fact is that it takes many days to get to the top and the levels of oxygen keep on decreasing with height. If you have previous experience of trekking, then you can adjust the pace and hence you can walk for many hours.</p><p>As the path gets steeper, the steps get smaller and rhythm remains same and that let you cover amazing distances and heights. While climbing mountains, if you talk and keep walking slowly and steadily for an hour or two, and when you stop for break, you will be amazed to look down and find that you have climbed to such a great altitude without even noticing. If you can walk in hilly areas for about six to eight hours and again next day you can do the same thing then you are more than fit for going for trekking on Kilimanjaro. That is all you need for this trekking.</p><p>You need to just find a comfortable rhythm so that your body switches to autopilot and your brain becomes neutral. This is the most efficient way by which your body copes with such situation and you will need least energy and oxygen. Suppose you need more breaks, then you have to walk faster, and you have to make sure that your speed constantly varies.</p><p>Camping is another aspect of <a href=\"https://mahiber.com/travel\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Tanzania Kilimanjaro climb</strong></a>. People have to sleep in tents and sometimes with minimal facilities. This trekking is physically demanding so you need to sleep well. If you hire the travel guide, then they will ensure that you get all the necessary facilities in your tent. There are thousands of people who are able to tackle this trek without any prior experience with help of our guide but it’s also true that if you have any prior experience then you can definitely benefit from that.</p>"

It is not an ideology like communism or capitalism. Rather, terrorism is a tactic – a strategy used to achieve a specific end.</p><p>Terrorism is often used when a weaker person, or group, is fighting against a powerful nation-state. The violence is aimed at creating fear in the targeted population and often provokes a prompt and violent response from the state. Terrorism is, in its broadest sense, the use of intentionally indiscriminate violence in order to achieve a political, religious, or ideological aim.</p><p align=\"center\"><em><u>Effect of Terrorism</u></em></p><p>Besides the injuries and deaths immediately brought about by terrorist attacks, survivors often suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and major depression. &nbsp;The economy suffers an immediate impact due to building and infrastructure damage, but it also suffers long-term effects from trauma to financial markets, a rise in spending on security and defense, and the impact on supply chains of enhanced security at land, sea and air border crossings.</p><p align=\"center\"><em><u>Terrorism in India</u></em></p><p>Terrorism in India, according to the Home Ministry, poses a significant threat to the people of India. Terrorism found in India includes ethnic-nationalist terrorism, religious terrorism, left-wing terrorism, and narco-terrorism. The regions with long term terrorist activities have been Jammu and Kashmir, east-central and south-central India (Naxalism) and the Seven Sister States.

These technological machines got involved in every area of our life; ranging from smartphones in our pockets all the way to the human robots. Whereas, machines have become an integral part of our daily lives. Robots are already replacing the labour force in some industries. At this point, many questions arise like, is the hypothesis of “robots bring unemployment in future” true? Will they change economy negatively or positively? Answering these questions, economists believe that, Robots not only decrease unemployment but also improves the economy of a country. Robots will replace the human being in the market, however, there still will be new jobs for human labour. &nbsp;</p><p>Technology never replaced a human being in the labour market. In fact, technology adds value to labour and increase efficiency. For instance, if now one accountant can do the job of 10 accountants with the help of a computer, one perspective is that technology killed those other 9 jobs. While on other perspectives, technology made this one accountant able to work 9 times more efficient. In addition, technology paved the way for other businesses to step in. because when the cost of doing business dropped down, more businesses come up, and economic cycle works faster.</p><p><img class=\"fr-dib fr-draggable\" src=\"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/atg-storage-s3/assets/Frontend/images/article_image/feature_inside-112000000020181315369160.png\" data-error=\"0\"></p><p>Machines help to create more job than before existed. Economist Henry Hazzilt believes that two out of three of us owe our jobs as well as our lives to machines. (Hazlitt, 1946) Let’s suppose the clothing manufacture company. Manufacturers after getting profit from their business, will spend their money in one of these three ways. He/she will buy more machines to expand their business which he/she will obviously need to hire more employees. Or the manufacturer will invest his profit in other businesses which will create employment for other entities. Or lastly, the manufacturer will spend the money to fulfil his daily needs which provide the job for small-scale businesses like tailor and baker and much more. Whichever way he spends the money. he directly or indirectly increases the employment and takes part in distributing the wealth among people.</p><p>In brief, technological improvement in a country do not kick people out of the work. It helps the economy to improve and jobs become more efficient after the interference of the technology in the market.&nbsp;</p><h1>References</h1><p>Coopers, P. W.

They are hunted by competing companies, while there are many who decide to start their own business. Others simply find other opportunities that your company cannot compete with.&nbsp;</p><p>This is very disappointing for the manager and the company as a whole since a great part of customers’ satisfaction relies on the work of charismatic employees. For this reason, some companies strive to develop a rate of renewal of their employees as a part of their policy.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the fight to keep good employees in your company is ultimately a lost game. Either because of death, retirement or job withdrawal, they all leave at some point. So, what rational managers can hope is to have some influence on who leaves and when he/she leaves</p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">As it is stated above, managers do not want&nbsp;</span>to lose invaluable partners. So, when this happens, a dozen of question <span lang=\"EN-US\">overwhelm their minds, such as “</span>What iswrong with me?”, “Could I have done something to prevent this person fromleaving?” After that, the consequences of employees’ withdrawal start to occupytheir minds: “What happened will not improve my performance evaluation at all. Will this upset the others? ”. Still, they wonder on how they can fill the gap of employees’ withdrawal and what it will cost in time and money for the company. Particularly, managers need to talk to the Human Resources department to start preparing the description of the job, publish the vacancy, examine in detail dozens of CV of each level, organize interviews and approve thousands of dollars in travel expenses. Then, they have to put the new person in pace, while all this time theywill still hope to find an employee as good as the person who left.</p><p>Without a doubt, losing a good partner is a big headache and creates nothing but negative thoughts and additional work. But do not let the negative thoughts affect your separation from the employee. In some cases, you do not even have to use the word separation.</p><p>Modern and smart companies they use the employees’ withdrawal to empower their relationship with those charismatic employees by monitoring their progress in their new position, by keeping update the confidential lists oftheir former employee, listing available positions and candidate information, providing free access to the company's latest research, and organizing events that bring alumni close to active workers</p><p>The whole essence of these programs is to keep former workers in touch with the company's business cycle even if their official ties have been cut.This is good for business. It also makes the business more than ever attractive to potential candidates who are interested in their careers and understand that by working in such a company they become part of a larger network of business professionals.</p><p>Keeping contacts with quietus workers can lead to new business activities, market information, and occasional re-entry of good people who have temporarily left.&nbsp;</p><p>But the effectiveness of these measures is determined by how the company managed to retire. When a good employee announces his/her impending resignation, did you deal with him badly? Did you d<span lang=\"EN-US\">isdain</span> him?</p><p>Some useful tips for sustaining good relationships with former employees</p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">You s</span>hould:</p><p>· Congratulate the person for the new step in his/her career</p><p>· Ask the human resources department to help the leaving person to complete the issues that relate to his/her withdrawal</p><p>· Showyour appreciation for what he/she has contributed to your company by organizinga farewell party</p><p>· Schedule to contact with him/her one or two months to see how it goes with his/her new job</p><p>· Keep him/her informed about job opportunities within your company</p><p><br></p><p>If things do not go as well as the leaving employee aspired, then this charismatic employee will definitely return back to you!</p>"

		"description" : "<p><span lang=\"EN\">Rapid economic growth and a high rate of staff turnover over the pastdecade have created a tiny business class that mediates between employers/companies and job seekers. These mediators operate under different names, such as employment agencies, recruiting staff, and executive search companies. Some of these offices are involved in general activities, while others specialize in specific fields, such as accounting, information or counseling sector.</span></p><p><a en\"=\"\" href=\"<p><span lang=\"><span lang=\"EN\">Most offices charge contractors, i.e. pay only if the candidate is recruited.The&nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">payment</span><span lang=\"EN\">&nbsp;generally amounts to 30% of the salary received bythe newcomer in the previous year. Those offices that are directly hired bybusinesses to gather a small number of qualified candidates receive a non-refundable advance or bureaucrats and expect to cover their expenses. So</span><span lang=\"EL\">,&nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN\">the</span><span lang=\"EN\">&nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN\">cost</span><span lang=\"EN\">&nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN\">is</span><span lang=\"EN\">&nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN\">rising</span><span lang=\"EL\">.</span></a></p><p><a en\"=\"\" href=\"<p><span lang=\"><span lang=\"EN\">These offices, if used properly, can save you time and money. In many cases, they do a lot better work. For example, specialized agencies generally have very active networks of suitable individuals in the industries they serve.</span></a></p><p><a en\"=\"\" href=\"<p><span lang=\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">If you have a vacancy in a remarkable position, headhunters will release your new vacancy quickly and confidentially to qualified individuals who may not be able to learn the position. They also carefully scrutinize who responds so that only qualified candidates are presented to you for evaluation. Finally, they can handle part of the deal, which can spoil acompany's future relationship with the employee. However, you have to decide iftheir services are worth the cost you will incur.&nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN\">It is clearly not necessary to use professional services when the board of directors is aware of suitable external candidates or when it plans to cover the position from the inside.</span></a></p><p><a en\"=\"\" href=\"<p><span lang=\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">So, let’s see some c</span><span lang=\"EN\">ases in which these services are not needed:</span></a></p><p><a en\"=\"\" href=\"<p><span lang=\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN\">when all the candidates are known to the board of directors,</span></a>&nbsp;</p><p><a en\"=\"\" href=\"<p><span lang=\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN\">when the requirements for the vacancy and the merit of the successful candidate's qualifications areclear,</span></a></p><p><a en\"=\"\" href=\"<p><span lang=\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN\">when the position to be covered does not require a highly qualified employee</span></a></p><p><a en\"=\"\" href=\"<p><span lang=\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">Nonetheless, i</span><span lang=\"EN\">n many other cases, there is a dire need of&nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">recruiting o</span><span lang=\"EN\">ffices. This happens when a company recruits a person for a very highposition that has a big impact on the low levels of the company. In addition,executive recruitment offices are often better than internal managers inconducting fast and confidential searches, which often require high-level jobpositions.</span></a></p><p><a en\"=\"\" href=\"<p><span lang=\"><span lang=\"EN\">Also, external assistance has also a contributory role when the expansion of a business creates new categories of job positions that companies do not actually understand, or when someone has to come from another industry with skills that are unknown to the company. Nonetheless, assigning the mission to employees’ hunters does not mean that the company recruits them or that its executives can be relieved of their responsibilities. Companies should continue to be involved in the employees’ search.</span></a>&nbsp;</p><p><a en\"=\"\" href=\"<p><span lang=\"><span lang=\"EN\">So, let’s see some tips that can help you to organize your HR management:</span></a></p><p><a en\"=\"\" href=\"<p><span lang=\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">S</span><span lang=\"EN\">elect a consultant, not just an office: Select a consultant as you would choose a prospective employee by interviewing the person who would be responsible for finding your employee and check the recommendations that he/she has from previous clients. How satisfied were they with his/her services? Will his/her consultant team remain intact during your cooperation?</span></a>&nbsp;</p><p><a en\"=\"\" href=\"<p><span lang=\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN\">Be aware of the potential conflict of interest: An office paid with commissions is usually not paid if the candidate selected is already an employee of the company. This may affect the staffing office to exclude your staff from the pool of candidates although its purpose is to find the best candidate for you. The remuneration for service provision can counteract this type of conflict.</span></a></p><p><a en\"=\"\" href=\"<p><span lang=\">· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span lang=\"EN\">Work as a team</span></a></p><p><br></p>"

Focusing on interpersonal relationships</span>: <span lang=\"EN-US\">Companies that are strictly divided into departments with little or no communication with each other are&nbsp;</span>condemned to fail<span lang=\"EN-US\">. Because of this, HR managers who aim at developing interpersonal relationships with everyone involved in the company help employees to be more&nbsp;</span>effective at their job<span lang=\"EN-US\">. Some ideas for doing this are organizing group activities and developing inter-relationships&nbsp;</span>workshops <span lang=\"EN-US\">(for example, through charts or through an online collaborative platform that encourages cross-project collaboration). These steps&nbsp;</span>assist<span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;to unify the business and create a collaborative environment in which all employees are able to express their opinions and exchange ideas that benefit the companies’ activities.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">3.

This would strengthen the morale of the workers and prevent personal conflicts</span>.&nbsp;</a></p><p>6.

		"description" : "<p>3D printing is any of various processes in which material is joined or solidified under computer control to create a three-dimensional object, with material being added together (such as liquid molecules or powder grains being fused together). 3D printing is used in both rapid prototyping and additive manufacturing. Objects can be of almost any shape or geometry and typically are produced using digital model data from a 3D model. There are many different technologies, used in the 3D printing process. The most common by number of users being fused deposit modeling (FDM). Thus, unlike material removed from a stock in the conventional machining process, 3D printing or Additive Manufacturing builds a three-dimensional object from a computer-aided design (CAD) model, usually by successively adding material layer by layer.<img class=\"fr-dib fr-draggable\" src=\"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/atg-storage-s3/assets/Frontend/images/article_image/feature_inside-12370000002018483926901.png\" data-error=\"0\"></p><p>The term \"3D printing\" originally referred to a process that deposits a binder material onto a powder bed with inkjet printer heads layer by layer. More recently, the term is being used in popular vernacular to encompass a wider variety of additive manufacturing techniques. United States and global technical standards use the official term additive manufacturing for this broader sense.<img class=\"fr-dib fr-draggable\" src=\"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/atg-storage-s3/assets/Frontend/images/article_image/feature_inside-12510000002018224184647.png\" data-error=\"0\"></p><p><br>A large number of additive processes are available. The main differences between processes are in the way layers are deposited to create parts and in the materials that are used. Each method has its own advantages and drawbacks, which is why some companies offer a choice of powder and polymer for the material used to build the object. Others sometimes use standard, off-the-shelf business paper as the build material to produce a durable prototype. The main considerations in choosing a machine are generally speed, costs of the 3D printer, of the printed prototype, choice and cost of the materials, and color capabilities. Printers that work directly with metals are generally expensive. However less expensive printers can be used to make a mold, which is then used to make metal parts.<br>ISO/ASTM52900-15 defines seven categories of Additive Manufacturing (AM) processes within its meaning: binder jetting, directed energy deposition, material extrusion, material jetting, powder bed fusion, sheet lamination, and vat photopolymerization.<img class=\"fr-dib fr-draggable\" src=\"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/atg-storage-s3/assets/Frontend/images/article_image/feature_inside-125300000020182141132487.png\" data-error=\"0\">Some methods melt or soften the material to produce the layers. In Fused filament fabrication, also known as Fused deposition modeling (FDM), the model or part is produced by extruding small beads or streams of material which harden immediately to form layers. A filament of thermoplastic, metal wire, or other material is fed into an extrusion nozzle head (3D printer extruder), which heats the material and turns the flow on and off. FDM is somewhat restricted in the variation of shapes that may be fabricated. Another technique fuses parts of the layer and then moves upward in the working area, adding another layer of granules and repeating the process until the piece has built up. This process uses the unfused media to support overhangs and thin walls in the part being produced, which reduces the need for temporary auxiliary supports for the piece. Recently, FFF/FDM has expanded to 3-D print directly from pellets to avoid the conversion to filament. This process is called fused particle fabrication (FPF) (or fused granular fabrication (FGF) and has the potential to use more recycled materials.</p><p><img class=\"fr-dib fr-draggable\" src=\"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/atg-storage-s3/assets/Frontend/images/article_image/feature_inside-124600000020181460080251.png\" data-error=\"0\"></p><p><br><img class=\"fr-dib fr-draggable\" src=\"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/atg-storage-s3/assets/Frontend/images/article_image/feature_inside-12230000002018392408287.png\" data-error=\"0\"></p>"

		"description" : "<p>A supercomputer is a computer with a high level of performance compared to a general-purpose computer. Performance of a supercomputer is measured in floating-point operations per second (FLOPS) instead of million instructions per second (MIPS). As of 2017, there are supercomputers which can perform up to nearly a hundred quadrillion FLOPS. As of November 2017, all of the world's fastest 500 supercomputers run Linux-based operating systems. Additional research is being conducted in China, the United States, the European Union, Taiwan and Japan to build even faster, more powerful and more technologically superior exascale supercomputers.</p><p><br></p><p>Supercomputers play an important role in the field of computational science, and are used for a wide range of computationally intensive tasks in various fields, including quantum mechanics, weather forecasting, climate research, oil and gas exploration, molecular modeling (computing the structures and properties of chemical compounds, biological macromolecules, polymers, and crystals), and physical simulations (such as simulations of the early moments of the universe, airplane and spacecraft aerodynamics, the detonation of nuclear weapons, and nuclear fusion). Throughout their history, they have been essential in the field of cryptanalysis.</p><p><img class=\"fr-dib fr-draggable\" src=\"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/atg-storage-s3/assets/Frontend/images/article_image/feature_inside-123300000020181105410151.png\" data-error=\"0\"></p><p>Supercomputers were introduced in the 1960s, and for several decades the fastest were made by Seymour Cray at Control Data Corporation (CDC), Cray Research and subsequent companies bearing his name or monogram. The first such machines were highly tuned conventional designs that ran faster than their more general-purpose contemporaries. Through the 1960s, they began to add increasing amounts of parallelism with one to four processors being typical. From the 1970s, the vector computing concept with specialized math units operating on large arrays of data came to dominate. A notable example is the highly successful Cray-1 of 1976. Vector computers remained the dominant design into the 1990s. From then until today, massively parallel supercomputers with tens of thousands of off-the-shelf processors became the norm.</p><p><img class=\"fr-dib fr-draggable\" src=\"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/atg-storage-s3/assets/Frontend/images/article_image/feature_inside-125300000020181086645464.png\" data-error=\"0\"></p><p>The US has long been a leader in the supercomputer field, first through Cray's almost uninterrupted dominance of the field, and later through a variety of technology companies. Japan made major strides in the field in the 1980s and 90s, but since then China has become increasingly active in the field. As of June 2018, the fastest supercomputer on the TOP500 supercomputer list is the Summit, in the United States, with a LINPACK benchmark score of 122.3 PFLOPS, exceeding the previous record holder, Sunway TaihuLight, by around 29 PFLOPS. Sunway TaihuLight's is notable for its use of indigenous chips and is the first Chinese computer to enter the TOP500 list without using hardware from the United States. As of June 2018, China had more computers (206) on the TOP500 list than the United States (124); however, US built computers held eight of the top 20 positions; the U.S. has six of the top 10 and China has two.<img class=\"fr-dib fr-draggable\" src=\"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/atg-storage-s3/assets/Frontend/images/article_image/feature_inside-12200000002018998581040.png\" data-error=\"0\"></p><p>Supercomputers are used for many different things in today’s society. For example, supercomputers are used to help predict the weather. Meteorologists use them to do research on the climate and global warming. Scientist use them for molecular modeling, which gives them the opportunity to compute the structures and properties of biological compounds. Supercomputers are also used for simulations, for example, the effect of wind and turbulence on an airplane; and the simulation of the effect of a nuclear weapon if it were to be detonated.The military also uses supercomputers for many different reasons. The US Army Tank-Automotive Command-Tank Automotive Research Development &amp; Engineering Center uses supercomputers to test new vehicles being engineered, to see how they will function in combat.</p>"

		"title" : "The costs of unethical behavior to business sustainability",
		"description" : "<p>Many businessmen face the concept of business ethics with wariness. This is because they believe that morality and entrepreneurial activity cannot coexist. Undoubtedly, there are entrepreneurs who act with the sole purpose of maximizing profits, having no moral barrier. However, <span lang=\"EN-US\">nowadays, business ethics is indeed a reality, since the&nbsp;</span>overwhelming majority of companies are acting responsibly and loyal to ethical values. If companies do not embrace the ethical values of the society, it is certain that they will lose their sustainability in the long run as society itself will fight against them.&nbsp;</p><p>Businesses as economic and legal entities that operate in society function at multiple levels: legal, economic and social. The moral dimension of corporate responsibility is involved at all levels and therefore the determination of various issues and what is right or not in decisions is influenced by the constituents of all these levels. So, for sure, a company must not violate the laws but be economically viable without, though, avoiding the demands of society, something that proves the complex role that each business plays in our modern world.</p><p><span lang=\"EN\">Today, businesses tend to draft a code of conduct in which the objectives of the enterprise will be the pursuit of profit and the satisfaction of all those&nbsp;</span>parties that are <span lang=\"EN\">directly connected with the enterprise and, on the other hand, its contribution to the realization of social harmony and the rise of the living level of society.</span></p><p>Every business has certain responsibilities towards the community and the state in which it operates, such as:</p><p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The supply of goods at acceptable prices to enable people to meet their needs.&nbsp;</p><p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Compliance with legislation and avoiding any undue action.&nbsp;</p><p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Making investments for society’s development and hence contributing to the economic growth and prosperity of the country where it operates.&nbsp;</p><p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The payment of taxes to the state according to its real possibilities.&nbsp;</p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span>The development of charitable and cultural activity that has beneficial effects on the community.</p><p><span lang=\"EN\">As far as unethical behaviors are concerned, when an enterprise prefers to approach its goals by following paths that do not respect social values and violate human rights then it will inevitably be faced with unpleasant situations.&nbsp;</span>The c<span lang=\"EN\">ost that such firms attempt to burden on the community by adopting unethical behavior is automatically passed on to it with a set of controversies and social responses.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">For example</span><span lang=\"EN\">, one of the ways in which workers react against authoritarian and unethical decisions which, in general, do not respect their rights are the pressures of the trade unions and the strikes which cost a lot of money for the company that is called upon to deal with it. Still, when unethical business conduct consists of environmental pollution and the inexhaustible use of natural resources or non-compliance with the legal or economic framework in place, the company is faced with large financial penalties or even the possibility of shutting down. It is further confronted with the defamation of its public image, which is a key determinant of its long-term viability and its long-term financial results.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN\">However, the most significant cost comes from the drop in the morale of workers who accept the negative climate of society and feel trapped in a system that does not play its role properly. The decline in unethical businesses’ productivity and profitability and consequently their increased costs is of minor importance compared to the detrimental effects that society’s reaction has to the business reputation.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN\">So, keep in mind this. Business ethics and social responsibility are not just theoretical concepts but have also a practical and severe impact on companies’ sustainability.&nbsp;</span></p>"

		"title" : "The role of mentors in the workplace",
		"description" : "<p>American culture applauds self-made people. Nonetheless, a few successful people are completely self-made. Most of them owe their success to a relative or a mentor who helped them to take the full advantage of life “courses” and guided them in their spiritual evolution.</p><p>The term \"mentor relationship\" refers to a personal and professional relationship between two people, in which an exchange of knowledge and experience with the aim of personal and professional development takes place. The mentor relationship is like a journey, in which the mentor and the mentee are fellow travelers. In this journey, the mentor strives to cultivate a climate of support and trust, to enhance mentees’ learning and to contribute positively to shaping their personal and professional identity.</p><p>In many cases, within the workplace, the role of the mentor is undertaken by people who have worked in a certain job for many years and have a great deal of work experience in a specific field. So, the prime objective of mentors is to translate their knowledge into the youngest at work in a simple way and encourage them to feel that by their self-improvement they can offer important work and be valuable to the company that they work for. At the same time, there are significant benefits for the company because it exploits the knowledge of the mentors who have many years of work experience at a much lower cost.</p><p>Mentors have the following characteristics. They set high standards, they are at employees’ disposal, and they are able to unify developmental experiences.</p><p>The role of mentors is preventive, educational, evolutionary and therapeutic. As for the preventive role, mentor prevents, anticipates, or sometimes blocks out various difficulties that may arise at the workplace, such as conflicts between employees. Also, the mentor's second role is educational /evolutionary, as they help individuals to make the best possible use of their abilities and modify the attitudes that are inefficient and dysfunctional in employees’ everyday life. Finally, mentors have a healing role since they support employees who are experiencing a challenging and very difficult situation. In addition to the above, mentors have many other roles, such as the researcher, when the mentor deals with research issues in counseling and an administrative role when providing administrative work to a counseling center or rehabilitation center. Other roles that mentors can take are the advocate, the human relations officer, the psychologist, and more importantly, the guider.</p><p>As a matter of fact, mentors create a strong bond between the employees and the company. The strength of this bond is undoubtedly determined by the effectiveness of the mentor and the intensity of the counseling relationship. This indicates that mentors should be chosen with great caution. So, if you are looking for a mentor, the perfect mentor is the one that can be identified with an employee who faces particular challenges, have nursing skills, they are the best example of the company culture, and they establish solid links with the company. So, the last thing you want to do is to develop a bond between a promising employee and a possible renegade. Nothing could spoil more the image of an employee for the company than to see a trustworthy mentor to leave from the company.</p><p>Some companies ensure that each employee has an identifiable official mentor. Others hold mentors for employees that are well-qualified and talented. If your company does not exploit effectively the mentors to develop the employees’ abilities, think about creating a consulting program. Start by recognizing people who would benefit from more than one programs with the collaboration of your leadership team and the human resources department, identify who would be effective and available to become mentors.</p><p><br></p>"

As it is commonly known, time is precious since it cannot be replenished in any way. Nonetheless, the rapid rhythm of modern life has made most of us run to fulfill our working obligations, something that fills us with anxiety.&nbsp;</p><p>Time management can help you to resolve this problem by organizing your time. It has been argued that time management is a habit and as with all habits it can be changed. To do this, you need to identify which habits are wrong, why there are wrong, and what needs should be done differently.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a topic for which dozens of books have been written and it is now taught inmany colleges and business studies universities. However, it can be summed up in two simple tips: Organize your daily schedule with notes and ... do not be hasty!</p><p>Particularly, the basic thing is to realize that as long as you are organized, the time does not change and the day continues to have 24 hours. What you can manage is yourself and what you can do with the time you have.</p><p>So, the goal is to change behavior and not just the way of your thinking.</p><p>A strong motive to start changing your behavior is to know the effects of poor management, which are the reduction of the hours of relaxation, the increase the level of stress and the lack of leisure time which in general leads to negative results in the long run and the development of an anxious or immature personality.&nbsp;</p><p>Particularly, bad time management leads to stress that is caused by the work that should be done and no one knows where to start. It is the biggest source of managerial stress. It leads to crisis management where one begins to react depending on who is pushing more and yelling louder. Mountains with documents are being formed and the office narrows below the burden of constantly postponed work, documents that have not even been seen, and challenges that have not been decided whether or not to be accepted.&nbsp;</p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Time management means getting control over how time is spent and making rational decisionsabout how to use it. It also means making better use of time, doing more in theavailable time, not spending time on unrelated issues, spending more time onimportant parts of work, and avoiding last-minute panic.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">As amatter of fact, effective time management is about identifying the activities that should be under our control, recognizing periods where we do not really have control over our activities and generally changing the way of our life inorder to be able to have control over our obligations.</span></p><p>Now,let’s see some possible errors in time management</p><p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We do what we like before what we do not like</p><p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We do what we know how to do it quickly, from what we do not know how to do it</p><p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We do the easy activities before the difficult ones</p><p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We do everything that takes less time than those that need a lot of time</p><p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We act on the demands of others before ours</p><p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We react directly to emergency crises</p><p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We do what promotes our personal goals&nbsp;</p><p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We wait for delaine before we act</p><p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We do what is done immediately</p><p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We respond based on who asks for something</p><p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We react based on the consequences that each activity has to us</p><p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We are dealing with small projects before the big ones</p><p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We deal with issues based on time of arrival</p><p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We are working on the principle of \"squeaky wheel\"</p><p>So, what you should do, it can be summarized in two keywords that you should have in mind before you decide seriously to manage your time. The one is ORGANIZATION and the otheris PRIORITY. Nothing can start unless you first organize the obligations you have to do, and then if you do not set priorities.</p>"

Below we will simply try to show the great importance of \"business planning\" to the success of the business and we will see how entrepreneurs can start their own business plan.</p><p>To start a business, it needs innovative business ideas, a strong management team, and an appreciable capital.<br>When these are done then we have the business.<br>However, having the capital and making the business to operate effectively is something different. It requires knowledge, business planning, and vision.<br><br></p><p>In which questions a business plan should answer?</p><p>· Where is your business now?</p><p>· Which would you like to see your business in the future?</p><p>· How do you plan to get there?</p><p>These are the three basic questions where a business plan calls for answers whether you have a kind of business or are planning to open a company in the future.<br>In any case, the business plan should be a clear and comprehensible presentation of the goals and activities that the business is about to develop.</p><p>Also, some useful questions you can ask yourself are:</p><p>· Why do you think your business idea will be sustainable?</p><p>· What products and services do you sell?</p><p>· Why should you choose a consumer rather than your competitors?</p><p>· What else can you offer?</p><p>· What market needs do you plan to cover?</p><p>It should be noted that many businessmen do not have clear answers to these questions and this can prevent the company from developing and profiting.</p><p>&nbsp;Drawing your business plan, you can make a description of your products by placing a special emphasis on how to use their customers.</p><p>What will be the benefit for the consumers if they purchase your product?</p><p>Also, it is imperative to show the reasons why your product will be successful on the market and continue with an analysis of the market you plan to operate by specifying the customers you address, and the profile of the consumer you are interested in making your customer, their habits, and income. What’s more, being aware of the competition that you may encounter is also very important for placing your business on the market. After doing an analysis of your products and services, customers and competitors, you can then describe who you would like to see your business after a few years, namely which is the vision that you have for the future and the personal lifestyle that you would like to live with.

		"title" : "Leasing agreements: Operating and capital lease",
		"description" : "<p>A lease agreement is a convention between the lessor and the lessee in the context of which it is agreed that the lessee will use a facility, such as equipment or other asset and as an exchange of these benefits, the lessee should give a predetermined amount of money to the lessor. As a rule, the lessor has the ownership of the asset and the lessee acquires the right to use it in exchange for the rental payments. So, if a company decides that it needs more assets to function well, then leasing may be the most beneficial solution as it is cost-effective and flexible concerning the payment conditions.&nbsp;</p><p>There are two types of leasing arrangement, the operating and the capital lease, each of which has certain features. The type of leasing agreement is imperative to be determined in order to be categorized accordingly to the GAAP rules, something that also affects the depreciation expenses of companies.&nbsp;</p><p>The operating lease is a rental lease which has a short-term duration and is referred mostly to the current assets of the company since with the expiration of the leasing; the equipment is returned to the owner. Also, it is a good choice if a company does not have adequate capital to buy equipment or an asset in general which can reinforce the dynamic of the company and usually the company’s operating activities. However, as it is stated above, for the use of this equipment and the assets that temporarily offered to the company, the latter should pay an amount of money (a periodic fee) as an exchange of the benefits that it earns. Such leasing agreement does not entail to be recorded in the balance sheet of the company according to GAAP provisions and thus companies save a lot of money since such transactions do not appear in the financial accounts of a company. Moreover, its usefulness is of paramount importance as firms can replace obsolete equipment with new one, thus increasing the capacity and the flexibility of company’s activities temporarily without needing to buy such equipment and acquire the risks that are followed from the ownership. As a matter of fact, the operating lease comes with a rental agreement and therefore the assets and the liabilities do not appear in company’ s balance sheet; though the lease payment is incorporated in the income statement as a rent expense (operating expenses) and lessen the company’s &nbsp;operating and the net income.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, the capital lease is associated with long-term investments; it has a long-term duration and aims to companies’ long-term assets. For this reason, it is like a purchase from an accounting aspect, as it permits the renter to utilize the leased asset for a long period. &nbsp;In particular, companies that are involved in the capital leasing procedure assign some risks concerning the possession of the equipment, while they have the ability with the expiration of the leasing to buy the equipment and thus toacquire an asset that has been already recorded to the company’s accounting books.&nbsp;</p><p>Nevertheless, a capital lease should have certain characteristics according to the GAAP provision. In fact, the duration of the lease should transcend the 75% of the assets’ life, the present value of the lease payments should exceed 90% of the fair market value of the asset, and when the lease comes to an end, the ownership of the asset is passed to the lessee. Otherwise, an operating lease may be more beneficial for a company. In general terms, the advantage of a capital lease is that the company incorporate an asset that has already used and tested; it has tax benefits due to the depreciation expenses and enjoys an increase on the book value of the asset, while the disadvantage is detected on the fact that the company bear the danger of becoming obsolete its leased asset at the time of purchasing.</p>"

		"description" : "<p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Leadership determined as&nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN\">the empowerment for influencing people toward ways of thinking, ways of action, and ways of renewing a tradition</span> and culture<span lang=\"EN-US\">. Given the crucial role that leader play&nbsp;</span>in<span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;the organization of companies leader</span>s tend<span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;to conglomerate more power than employees. Based on this statement, Lord Acton wrote that “power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely”. This means that when people accumulate power, they tend to be more autocratic, believe in themselves&nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">exorbitantly,and disregard the opinions of others. &nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">This phenomenon has also been explained by many researchers who illustrate the notion that it is in peoples’ nature to have greed as a trait of people’s personality. So, people have the ability to develop this feeling or mitigate it depending on the circumstances, the environment, and the opportunities emerged. This perspective has been stressed by Aristotle, who suggested that people are potentially good and potentially evil, and the goal of a person is to achieve well-being. To accomplish this, it is necessary to reach the medal.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">In the business environment, many leaders who are extravagant ambitious or have an unexpected success seems not to control their feelings and are characterized by selfishness. As a matter of fact, they tend to behave in an authoritarian manner because they believe that they are always right due to their position and achievements. Therefore, the more power it has a person, the more corruption exist. On the contrary, when power distribute</span>s<span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;among the employees, each member feels responsible f</span>or<span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;their actions and their collective purpose.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">History has ascertained this aspect. An indicative</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;example is Adolf Hitler, who was an ambitious person thirsting for power. He deluded people appearing himself as a charismatic leader and convinced them to trust him. The consequences are commonly known. He led millions of people to death and “polluted” the minds of many people with immoral ideas. This example constitutes a distinctive indication of the corruption that an extravagant power causes.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">However, power does not always induce corruptive behaviors. When leaders have an ethical attitude and imbue with virtues and courtesy values can administrate their power in good purposes and prompt to transformational leadership. To go one step further, this kind of leaders may teach and inspire other people to follow their steps and exemplifies by their code of behavior. In such&nbsp;</span>a <span lang=\"EN-US\">situation, leaders function as a model of behavior and may have a positive effect on other people and especially employees. They can direct other’s people step by providing guidelines&nbsp;</span>for <span lang=\"EN-US\">more ethical behavior. Therefore, e</span><span lang=\"EN\">thical leaders must consistently make correct moral decisions and judgments, even under challenging circumstances.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">There are many ways that a leader can avoid corruption from power. The key to success is self- awareness. Leaders who have much power should be aware of their capabilities and their weakness to achieve self-control. Apart from that, motivators play a major role in people’s action. When leaders have a purpose, they do the best they can to achieve it. For example, Machiavelli said that&nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN\">the&nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">purpose</span><span lang=\"EN\">&nbsp;justifies the means</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">. This statement has triggered heated debate, because it led him to justify actions that considered as unethical, besides his prestigious personality. So, the purpose, the motivators and the means to achieve a goal should be clarified and assessed. If these three elements align with an ethical consideration, the actions of such a leader should reward given that strengthen socialize <span lang=\"EN-US\">power by providing guidelines to people. This means that self-satisfaction should not be the prime mover for leaders’ actions.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\"><span lang=\"EN-US\">So, leaders <span lang=\"EN-US\">should understand that in all democratic organizations, the power originates from the trust of others and thus leaders should be <span lang=\"EN-US\">responsible for the administration of power in a way that serves the purpose of society to eschew from corruptive behaviors.</span></span></span></span></p><p><br></p>"

Some women leave their work when their children are babies but they are ready to return after a few years. Some others leave to do what they consider to be a big step in their careers, only to be disappointed and land later in reality.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN\">In any case, when we get used something, it is very difficult to adjust our behavior and attitude to something new. For this reason, many researchers are convinced that such changes bring about a variety of negative effects on people that are willing to taste something different, especially during the adjustment period. This is because employees should start from the zero, prove their abilities, gain the appreciation and the respect of the others, and build effective professional relationships between their colleagues etc.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN\">On the other hand, re-hiring employees can be a valuable asset for each and every company for many reasons. Firstly, they know your business and how things work there. This gives them the big advantage over other employees recruited for the first time who generally take many months to learn the work and become productive. Respectively, this entails costs and time for the company which should train new employees to ensure that they are able to keep pace with the rhythm of the company, its culture, and strategy. Secondly, the employees that return to their previous job can benefit the company by disseminating and exploiting the experiences and in many cases, with new skills</span><span lang=\"EN\">&nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN\">acquired by the new job. Particularly, if such an employee worked for a long time to your company, it is more likely that such absence may rejuvenate them and when they return they will be able to share with others what they have learned and how other companies work. Finally, every renegade promotes to others a strong and clear message: that the stranger is no sweeter!<br></span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN\">Some things that can be done to increase the number of employees that they re-recruited:</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN\">· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN\">Eliminate the problems that urge your employees to leave.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN\">· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN\">Make interviews with employees that want to leave from your company and direct investigation of the reasons of employees’ leaving. This is the best way to determine the underlying causes of excessive numbers of employees’ resignation.&nbsp;</span></p><p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span lang=\"EN\">If you find that a bad manager drives your most skillful and talented employees to quit due to his/her behavior, replace him/her and then call the best of employees who left to return.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN\">· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN\">Keep open communication lines between your company and your best employees that chose to leave.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN\">· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN\">Strive to communicate with employees that left frequently. Ask them how they go to their new life and keep them informed about the job vacancies in your company.</span></p><p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span lang=\"EN\">Make the re-recruitment as easy as possible. There is a relative concern about returning someone to the old company.

		"title" : "Why capital budgeting decisions may be risky?",
		"description" : "<p>Capital budgeting is the planning process that helps to be determined whether an organization’s long-term investments are worth the funding of cash through firms' capital. Capital decisions depend on the availability of funds, the relationship between the proposed projects, the company’s basic objectives, and the risk associated with a particular project. For this reason, the main responsibility of a manager is to examine all the available investments and opt for acquiring or selling assets that can bring more profits to the company by predicting the cash flows that will be received from the alternatives recognizing the characteristics of each project, and evaluating their credits. So, while capital budgets assist a manager to systematically analyze potential business opportunities and select investments that add value to the company through its expansion or the amelioration of its activities, it involves lots of risk factors that should be taken into consideration.&nbsp;</p><p>A capital budgeting decision is very difficult for a manager because the outcome is uncertain since the decision is based on assumptions and predictions for the expected future year’s cash flows. At the same time, large amounts of money usually involved and a long-term commitment is required. Also, there is always the danger of a misleading plan that is set incorrectly at the beginning thus demotivating department staff. In fact, the identification and the measurement of the costs and the benefits of an investment in fixed assets require endless calculations and lengthy process. This becomes even more difficult when the period for calculation is very long given that the manager should consider multiple parameters to conclude in an accurate outcome.&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, the decision could be difficult or impossible to reverse. The investment decisions regarding the funding of long-term assets are not easily reversible once it is applied given that if it emerged such a need, then the firm may burden with a significant financial loss. Another situation in which capital budgeting can be risky for a manager is when the company does not have sufficient resources to fund all the available projects, meaning that the funding needs exceed the funding resources. In these situations, many managersmay get carried away with the elegance of the investments and fund so many projects that are not affordable by the company in the long run. This combined with the management reluctance to issue external financial reports because of projects’ higher costs will lead the managers to abstain from the marginally acceptable projects to maintain reserve NPV projects that may be detected later.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, capital budgeting emanates some ethical issues that are arisen when the manager starts to think about investment. In fact, biases are another factor that can endanger the efficacy of a capital budget. Managers tend to reject investments if these investment request for the manager to collaboratewith someone with whom they have negative feelings. This also happens even if the projects have high expected value and is less risky than the alternative investment. Simultaneously, if manager’s feelings are characterized by more affection due to the interpersonal relationship created, then it can lead to the same unfavorable outcome.</p><p>What’s more, it is observed that managers are more prone to make a decision when faced with limited alternatives. So, when there is a great variety of alternatives, managers hesitate to make a decision, especially when they are less experienced in investment projects. Finally, studies have shown that managers that try to overcome risk projects tend to turn down investments that show a positive impact on the company and have a low level of risk. Conversely, the same people seem to take risks only if the option was chosen was failed and thus they decide to invest in projects that have a high level of risks. Undoubtely, such behaviors are dangerous for a company.</p><p><br></p>"

Each company that aims to keep its most valuable employees and fill gaps created by retirement and expansion needs to devote resources to career development.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Companies that give opportunities for career development create a strong body of people who will one day lead the company as skilled professionals, managers, and senior executives. For this reason, it is commonly known that career development is a form of internal recruitment. In essence, when a reputable company supports career development, it can attract individuals who are serious about building their careers.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Human resources specialists when they talk about career development are often referred to career scales. The career ladder is a rational succession of stages that progressively drives to a charismatic and dedicated employee into more challenging and fulfilling positions. For example, in the publishing industry,a n employee with ambitions can go through different positions in production or marketing to become an assistant editor and finally an editorial editor.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Formal training of the career development procedure is generally considered an important element in the various stages of the career scale. For example, an ambitious publishing director may need to attend a 3-day lesson on electronic publishing and perhaps another one on legal issues, such as contracts and intellectual property laws.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Some companies systematically analyze employees’ current level of skills and experience and contrast them with the skills and experience required to reach the next scale. After that, the gaps identified between employees’ skills and the attributes they needed are dealt with through a plan that includes a formal training design, assignment of specific tasks, and endless consultancy by specialized seniors’ managers.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN\">In terms of employee retention, the career scale method has better results as it avoids stagnation. Employees should always feel that they learn something and are motivated through a range of new responsibilities that they can manage. In other words, there must be plenty of enthusiasm. Otherwise, employees may fell that they are stuck in a stagnant career. This sense creates a prospect of retirement.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN\">If conditions hinder the progress of a promising employee, the manager must assign to these employees a sort of side-by-side job that will attract the employees’ interest and provide them with cognitive experience. It is the managers’ responsibility to ensure that the employees have a gradual upward course in their careers. Their development is good for employees as it increases the likelihood of staying in the company that they work for.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN\">Employees' development have significant benefits for the company since:</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=\"EN\">it exploits the value of the company's human resources which are the main resources for many companies in a growing number of industries</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">it</span><span lang=\"EN\">&nbsp;ensures that qualified people are ready and able to be promoted in an increasing number of disciplines</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN\">it creates a pool of employees who know the company and the industry and who are ready to take the lead as the business evolves.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN\">it contributes to the effective maintenance of employees</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">To sum up, investing in employees’ career development albeit it entails a significant budget for the company, it can ensure big profits and pleased workers, hence the company’s good reputation!</span></p>"

		"description" : "<p>Without a doubt, customers are an invaluable source for business, and for this reason, there are many things that managers should consider to explore the factors that affect their purchasing decision. However, from the beginning, it should be clarified that the value-added features that make customers to prefer a product/service instead of the other do not only rely on the products/services amelioration as a commodity merely.&nbsp;</p><p>Besides, if that is the case, the only differentiate advantage between companies would be the prices, a fact that will quickly lead products to become obsolete and companies’ strategies less effective. As a result, companies would not have any chance to achieve a high margin of sales and expect to have long-term growth. So, the thoughtful examination of the factors that add value to them is very important to be done.</p><p>The traditional theory of the consumers’ behavior which investigates this theme supported that the brand name, the location of the business, the packaging, the reputation, and the product/service price are some factors that add value to the customers. This is because, as value elements consider all the things that influence the costs and profits of the offering in the customer’s business. Simultaneously, the wide range of all these factors explains why customers have different perceptions about what they need from a product or service and why they have different interests.</p><p>For example, for some customers brand name and company’s reputation are of primary importance because they symbolize a kind of prestige and enhance their status quo. Moreover, product placement and location of the business is also very significant since customers expect to have comfortability. Hence, if a company locates in a very isolated place, then the customers will find difficult to approach the business, and they will be more likely to underestimate its value.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>For this reason, e-commerce has achieved to dominate as a new way of marketing since the available products are accessible easily to them whenever they want.</p><p>Also, the aesthetic of the product may be pivotal in some cases especially if the nature of the product based on this. For instance, a mobile phone or a car should have not only a competent function but also an attractive packaging because customers do not only care about products’ functionality but also for their appearance.</p><p>What's more, pricing is another parameter that adds value to customers since the cost of it, in many cases, shows if the company respects the customers’ needs and if tries to make its products/services approachable to them. Another feature that adds value to the product/service is its real or perceived characteristics to the customers, meaning that it should have some specific features, and especially premium quality that differentiates them from other similar products and benefits customers.</p><p>In this context, it is supported that the product or service should be functional exhaustive, operational connective and aesthetic coherent. Therefore, a manager should know very well the target customer that he/she addresses and their need. However, knowing the customer needs requires maintaining a great relationship with them, so that feel that they participate in the delivery of the product or the service. Hence, the frequent interaction between the company and the clients along with the provision of excellent customer services through which the demands of the customers are satisfied at once is an effective way to increase the value of the product in the perception of a company and a successful tool to “beat” competition.</p><p>Finally, the features that add value to the customer are those that encourage customer satisfaction and offer a life-changing experience. All the above characteristics are only some of them that a leader should consider when it comes to the design thinking process.</p>"

		"description" : "<p>If there was any interest in the revisiting of the &quot;interpersonal communication&quot; within the alleged international web village, it would be appropriate to complete the image with a similar brief glance on the Internet features.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The ethological observations we have seen from time to time may be valid concerning to the communication via the Internet. However, here it has its place-a more general observation. As in various other issues caused by the development of technology, the new technological means of communication (typography, telegraph, telephone, radio, Internet), it seems that the fresh ethical challenges are not at all new. They are simply enlarged but without introducing a new category of reflection: the multitude of their repercussions, their intensity and the temporal depth of their consequences are all increased significantly. However, there are no &quot;new&quot; qualities of ethical concern.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In principle, the low cost, the fluency and the almost unlimited scope of communication between individuals and ideas have already contributed to the productive and cultural development. However, we do not yet have sufficient empirical data on the malfunctioning of the Internet in order to establish a convincing theory and to be able to move rationally towards an optimization. Nonetheless, we must to systematically record the disputes and the side effects. And for those associated with Internet use for advertising purposes, we apply what we noted for the advertisement last time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the more specific direction of the confirmatory communication between individuals (a direction whose feuilleton underline particularly importance), it is interesting to note that the Internet has actually created new conditions:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A) The number of messages you receive may give you additional choice and time available, though,with adverse effects on your mental health. And the potential consequences of &#39;solitary &#39; work, somewhere here are classified.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>B) The prevalence of English has broadened the communication between people that come from different cultural backgrounds with all the humanistic consequencesof this event.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>C) The phenomenon of &quot;friends&quot; search on the Internet has not yet been sufficiently analyzed. No one can disavow the fundamental communication pleasure that this street offers. However, it has been recognized that anonymity and heteronomy (the possibility of retiring completely and unilaterally from the relationship) may invalidate the benefit of the institution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>D)The ability to harm individuals or groups via the Internet (from promotion to abuse, to theft of funds), sometimes sounds nightmarish. And it shows how muchcommunication can be put in a society. The scale differs only and unfortunately differs exponentially.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, we should take into account that there are millions of disabled people around the world (blind, deaf, paralyzed, etc.) who, thanks to additional Braille software, vocal composition etc are now able to communicate on the Internet, study and communicate with anyone staying pinned in the wheelchair or in the prison room.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To sum up, Internet is a modern way of communication that facilitates our lives in various ways and achieves to increase its quality. As this constitutes an important asset, we should not forget that Internet is a blessing to some extent!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

		"description" : "<p>The quality management strategy is a relatively recent phenomenon which is the result of the constant search for a stable competitive advantage in the context of growing market competition. The strategic approach to quality, due to its preventative nature, is considered the most appropriate for the diversification of the services offered, as opposed to the occasional effort to improve the quality that is expressed in response to market needs and therefore is passive.</p><p>Critical variables for the success of quality management have identified the time, organizational transformation towards aculture of quality with modern technology. The intensity of quality management activities is considered to affect not only the quality but also the ability ofthe business to respond to the customer's needs in a flexible way.</p><p>Quality management, as a universal approach, is based on specific fundamental principles:</p><p>• A client orientation that includes both the outside and the interior, as a common goal of the efforts of the whole organization and its members</p><p>• Process orientation that enables them to be analyzed in key tasks, as part of the quality chain with specific customers and</p><p>• The continuous improvement of products andservices through the use of people in identifying and implementing the appropriate changes.</p><p>To improve service quality, companies should:</p><p>• Focus on the market and the customers that allow the diagnosis of their needs and expectations and the manifestation ofsuch actions</p><p>• Independent responsibility of first-lineworkers that gives them the power to make important customer service decisions</p><p>• The existence of properly trained staffwith development opportunities and reward systems and recognition and performance evaluation; and</p><p>• The existence of a clear service qualityvision that precludes the arbitrary interpretation of quality service and the inconsistency of its efforts to improve and the variability of the results</p><p>Of course, a strong competitive strategy cannot be realized without the existence of stable and competent human resources, as the high dynamism of the markets has made it an important source of competitive advantage.</p><p>The human resources capabilities and theircontinuous upgrading and enrichment are a strategic determinant of quality andhigh economic outcomes. The more skilled and knowledgeable the human potentialis, the more appropriate it is to design processes and offer services that bestmeet customer needs.</p><p>Proper encouragement and the provision ofdevelopment perspectives are favorable conditions in this direction. The needto continually improve quality and increase productivity often leads companiesalong with their dramatic cost cuts, to reductions in their human resources,which entails additional staffing difficulties for the remaining staff. Qualitymanagement requires a flexible, competent and high commitment to the commonhuman resources objectives.</p><p>Finally, technology is referred to as a means oflimiting the complexity of service processes, expanding the possibilities ofoffering services of many different choices, with significant economies ofscale. The use of technology, in addition to the partial substitution of humanlabor (as in the case of ATMs), gives new dimensions to the skills and skillsof workers. It is believed to upgrade their knowledge and enhance thedevelopment of their skills in the services they provide and in customerservice</p>"

		"description" : "<p>Fixed or static budgets are financial budgets that characterized by stability and do not change in the course of the year, even if the costs of actual activities are modified. In fact, fixed budgets are constructed before the beginning of the fiscal year and based on the financial data that the company collects until then. While fixed budgets have a number of advantages, given that they urge employees and managers to be consistent with the budget plan, and facilitates the calculation of tax liabilities there are certain limitations and disadvantages to its usefulness for a manager.</p><p>So, the fixed or static budgets encompass many restrictions, as it focuses only on one level of activity and has a single planned volume including a specific amount of money that the company decides to allocate in its activities. This decision relies on the production expectations without taking into consideration unpredictable facts, meaning that the manager is restricted by the budget that should be followed strictly. Thus, even if a department or an activity needs to be empowered emergently, the manager cannot allocate additional sources to be improved even if this action is profitable of the company in the long run hence putting a burden in the cost allocation process.</p><p>As a result, such consequences can affect negatively the company's revenue flow due to the fact that it can provoke an extensive lack of trust and extra stress on the behalf of employees for overcoming the budget besides their efforts. For this reason, in practice, fixed budgets do not serve the needs of the real market world because many unpredictable events may emerge that demand to be arranged at a specific time.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, the basic limitation of the fixed budget is the lack of adaptation to changes. Moreover, new companies may meet challenges using fixed budgets because in the majority of the cases, the data retrieved may be based on past data or past experiences of other companies or competitors. Hence, new companies or start-ups may need to put an additional effort (time and money) to combine these data with the particularities of its company frequently falling to do so due to the lack of experience and customers’ demand.&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, as it is previously stated, given that companies operate in a dynamic market environment, they dealt with unpredictable changes and thus they should be able to balance their variable expenses.&nbsp;</p><p>Nevertheless, the costs in a fixed budget may divergent with actual costs leading to an increased uncontrolled situation in the fiscal period that a fixed budget applied. As a matter of fact, the fixed budget can prove to be deceptive and impractical, given that the units are ignored in the cost’s comparison and hence it is an inappropriate method of controlling a company’s costs.&nbsp;</p><p>Consequently, the only situation that a fixed budget can function well for the purposes of the company is when the company has a monopoly thesis in the market, the market is characterized by relative stability in this particular field of operation and when the company’s costs are basically fixed costs.</p>"

However, in cultures in which people are thought to be free to change jobs, the main incentives to remain in the company are:</p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">1.

This is because the individual success many times depends on the collaboration with other employees. Such collaboration may take the form of advice or a proposed solution to a difficult problem.&nbsp;</p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">5.&nbsp;</span>M<span lang=\"EN-US\">eaningful work:&nbsp;</span>Employees <span lang=\"EN-US\">want to take on companies that allow them to engage in work that focuses on their deeper interests.

The value proposition to the employee is something similar to the value proposition&nbsp;</span>of the<span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;company, consciously or unconsciously,&nbsp;</span>because it offers<span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;to its customers a measure of perception of value fora particular cost. They argue that if companies want to be more successful in attracting and retaining talent</span>ed employees<span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;they need to evaluate and enhance value propositions for their employees.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">In order to create an irresistible value proposition to the employee</span>,<span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;the company must provide the basic resources that executive management seeks-exciting work, an important company, attractive pay and development opportunities.

Therefore, it goes well without saying that selecting the right suppliers are the most important initial step towards opening a successful brand. When it happens that the supplier messes up your order, your business and you are the one responsible for it, so the key is to look for someone that will stick with the plan and have an open communication when there are issues that will arise in the future of team-up.</p><p><img class=\"fr-dib fr-draggable\" src=\"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/atg-storage-s3/assets/Frontend/images/article_image/feature_inside-01300000002019173841632.png\" data-error=\"0\"></p><p>Below are some of the factors to bear in mind when selecting the dropshipping supplier:</p><p>1. Look for the experienced dropshipper with helpful sales agents. Nothing beats experiences. A dropshipper who is aware of the pitfalls of dropshipping and about how you can handle them effectively, coupled with the sales representative that will answer any queries will surely put your mind and worries at ease, and it will make a really good team-up and will definitely reflect a positive impression on your business.</p><p>2. Look for a dropshipper that will provide high quality, top-notch products. The high quality products give way to a high level of consumer satisfaction and that means a lower cost of unsatisfied customers and returned items. Testimonials and product reviews will go a very long way in boosting business, thus, having the best quality products are imperative.</p><p>3. Look for a dropshipper that has technological capabilities. When choosing your dropshipper, be sure that they know some technological abilities in keeping up with the time. When you want to scale up your business, it might be a disgrace if you have to break the great business alliance with your dropshipper just so they would not be able to maintain with your growth.</p><p>4. Look for the dropshipper who is efficient and punctual with the dropshipping process. Dropshippers that are shipping products within 24-48 hour period is the great way to make sure that the customers are being satisfied and happy. Because of the market’s competitiveness, long shipping times may be unattractive to your customers. This can be advisable to put on your test orders with the suppliers to see how they process their work and to have the best idea before you come up with the final decision of choosing them as your suppliers.</p><p>This may sound really simple, but, Google will be a best bet when searching for your future dropship suppliers. Some of the websites and startup incubators dedicated to Ecommerce, which pop up as hunt results, will have the entire directories of Dropshippers with the contact details. The moment you have acquired the contact details for the dropshipping supplier that are providing products you have an interest in selling, then, send them some polite, short email asking a few of your relevant questions. By this way, you will be able to gauge about how rapidly they respond and about how helpful the sales representatives are.</p><p>It is not always likely to know whether your suppliers and you will be of perfect fit right off a bat, but, it is likely to ask some questions that can make the vetting procedures more efficient.</p><p><span class=\"fr-video fr-dvb fr-draggable\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"true\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wBlYHIxHlM4\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></span></p><p><a href=\"https://www.famousbirthdays.com/people/josh-madrid.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><small>Josh King Madrid</small></a><small>&nbsp;better known as Jet, is a successful serial entrepreneur, investor, marketing specialist, coach and CEO of Team Jet Set, he specializes in the industries of e-commerce, marketing, business consulting, and fitness.</small></p>"

		"title" : "Leasing agreement and its importance in companies’ depreciation expenses",
		"description" : "<p>The leasing arrangement plays a huge rule in the depreciation expense, since the February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) decided that the leases apart from the short-term one (operating lease) should be capitalized; thus posing a major effect on the companies’ balance sheets. However, the accounting ramifications concerning the tax regulations and the way that the lease is booked depend on the type of leasing, namely if it is an operating or a capital lease.&nbsp;</p><p>In the case of the capital lease, the leased equipment is listed on the fixed assets of the company, is appeared on the company’s balance sheet and is prone to depreciation. In particular, the money paid for the leased equipment is cited as a liability on the accounting books and equals the asset value. In essence, the value that is attributed to the asset could be either the fair market value of the leased material or the present value of the lease payment and it is also illustrated on the company’s income statement. Moreover, the interest that the company pays for the leased equipment is considered as an interest expense and the depreciation of the equipment as a depreciation expense which, in turn, lessen the taxes that the company should pay to the government since the expenses decrease the net income. Therefore, the book value of the asset decreases with the passage of the time. As a matter of fact, these additions in the financial statements of the company affect the company’s competency, because it reduces the return on assets, the assets turnover ratios, the profitability ratios, and the company’s financial leverage(long-term solvency ratio).&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, an operating lease is deemed as an operating expense and the lease payment is recorded as operating expense, while the leased equipment is not involved in the income statement either as an asset or liability because the company that it uses the equipment does not have the ownership of it. &nbsp;Thus, the company that leases the equipment should record the payments that have made as rental expense and credit its lease in the payable account. Finally, when the periodic lease obligation is amortized, the company documents credit to the cash account and debit the lease to the payable account. Respectively, the lessor should record the periodic depreciation by charging the depreciation expense account and crediting the accumulated depreciation account on his/her balance sheet.&nbsp;</p><p>To sum up, the nature of the leasing arrangement and the type of them affect companies’ cash flow and determine companies’ opportunities to benefit from the depreciation expense from a tax-deductible perspective.

		"description" : "<p>The statement of cash flows, as one of the fundamental financial statements, is undeniably an important statement for both internal and external users, because it can be used in evaluating a company's financial standing. Cash flows enable the company to pay expenses, debts, employees’ wages, taxes, and investments in assets needed for its operation. As a matter of fact, without sufficient cash flows, a company cannot grow and prosper.&nbsp;</p><p>In particular, the cash flow analysis is a financial statement that depicts the cash receipts, the cash payments of a company and the relevant activities of it that help the manager to make crucial investments and operational decisions. Moreover, while the income statement presents many similarities with the cash flow statement, they are not the same, because, the fact that a company appears to have profits on its income statement, it doesn't mean that it will not meet barriers later because of the possible inadequacies in its cash flows.&nbsp;</p><p>So, the contribution of cash flow in assessing the healthiness of company’s financial situation is of primary importance, because the manager can accurately predict the cash difficulties that a company may encounter and create an effective strategy and a cash budget plan by comparing the company’s finance at the beginning of the fiscal year with the end. Besides such information are also significant to investors that are interested in companies that have a great amount of money to display on their operating activities and make appropriate developing investments. For all these reasons, it is important the cash of operating activities surpass the net income.&nbsp;</p><p>Regarding the categories of the activities that are involved in the cash flow, they are recorded values that stem from operation activities, investment activities, and the financing activities. The operation activities are those that include the amount of money that the company gives for goods/service sales deducting the costs of manufacturing them. Important categories that are associated with operating activities involve the cash associated with accounts receivable, accounts payable and inventories. In fact, operating activities constitute the main internal source of company’s cash production, because the manager can design the future budget based on these relevant activities. Furthermore, the investment activities represent the amount of money that the companies pay for the facilities to maintain the company thriving, namely the company’s assets that stem from selling a number of its investments or the investments in which the company should pay to obtain them. In this context, the changes in the investment cash flow are precious for business profitability because they are related to the expansion of the company and the improvement of its products or services.&nbsp;</p><p>However, it should be noted that the assets should be adapted to the nature of the company, because different businesses need different assets so as to function well. As a matter of fact, the cash inflows can be derived by selling fixed and intangible assets or investments, while the cash outflows can stem from payments to purchase fixed, intangible assets and payments to purchase investments.&nbsp;</p><p>What’s more, the finance activities are compromised by the inventories and the intangible assets of the company that derives from external funding and help the firm to start operating. For this reason, they depict the relationship between creditors and owners and capital markets and investors. Consequently, &nbsp;the financial activities are valuable sources of investors who are interested to be informed about the financial situation of the company and specifically the amount of money and the frequency that the company increases its capital, as well as the way that amortizes its debts during the fiscal year.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>"

		"description" : "<p>Nowadays, the more important the role and presence of private businesses is, the more critical it becomes to analyze and critique business ethics and social responsibility.&nbsp;</p><p>Ethicsis characterized as a system of values, rules, and perceptions which decisively influences the character, the action and the attitude of citizens and social groups. It is a system that determines the will and the actions of people, the origin, the essence and the content of the rules and values that determine peoples’ choices and behaviors as good and right.</p><p>In many countries, there has been an increased interest in corporate social responsibility and ethics. Social responsibility consists mainly of business relations with the external environment. Administrative ethics is a broader concept, which consists of the business relationship with its internal and external environment.</p><p>Today's ideology gives companies social roles within every social or political system that they have to serve. The prevailing view of the business is integrated into a more general economic system, a subsystem which it ought to serve.</p><p>From this perspective, the enterprise is composed of employees and sometimes conflicting groups that have requirements from its resources. Therefore, the business manager should combine the realization of economic goals within a pluralistic political environment that respects and creates human values. All these features depict the need and the cultivation of the concept of corporate governance.&nbsp;</p><p>The concept of Corporate Governance is not new as it appears alongside the creation of the first Public Limited companies in the 19th century. Corporate Governance is nothing more than a system of principles on the basis of which an enterprise is run and managed to preserve and satisfy the legitimate interests of all those related to the company within the company's interest. In other words, it aims at permanently serving the interest of the company as a legal entity of the stakeholders and not just the shareholders in procedures of full transparency and providing vital information so that they also have an active role in the company's activity.</p><p>The principles of Corporate Governance are voluntary commitments that contribute tothe company's preservation and credibility and aim to promoting the long-term and balanced development of the company. Only companies that apply Corporate Governance principles can have healthy and long-term business growth.</p><p>If we try to isolate the keywords in the principles of Corporate Governance we would choose the words Transparency and Information, Stakeholders, Development. If the development of a company is the intended business outcome then the transparency of procedures and the provision of information to stakeholders are the prerequisites for achieving the result. In other words, today anything that makes a business positive or negative is immediately known.</p><p>Transparency in business practices is no longer a luxury but a requirement. Customers and consumers want to know what's inside the company. They do not want to deal with companies that do not trust or appreciate. But even when these conditions exist, it does not mean that the desired result is achieved. Close monitoring of products and services, brandsand logos, returns and profit margins is no longer enough.</p><p>In the emerging global market, companies are judged on the basis of environmental protection measures, workers' relationships, community relations, and generally, they are judged by their sensitivity and interference with modern social problems.&nbsp;</p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">So, corporate governance is without a doubt, the only future that businesses have.&nbsp;</span></p>"

Family problems, personal worries etc. may provoke bad feelings to employees that influence their mood and their job performance.

At this point, employees are more likely to&nbsp;</span>decide to quit their job and leave<span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;companies for many different reasons.</span> Some of these reasons are:</p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">1. Company&nbsp;</span>l<span lang=\"EN-US\">eadership </span>c<span lang=\"EN-US\">hanges: For example, the quality of senior administration departures declines or a newl eadership which employees do not trust or feel comfortable with takes the lead. Do not overestimate situations in which the leaders change and his/her place is taken by someone adopted an authoritarian leadership style that statistically is not preferable by the majority of the employees.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">2. Conflict with direct deputy: People can also leave when their relationship with their superiors becomes pressing or problematic and they do not see any other alternative within their company.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">3. Close friends leave: One or more colleagues whom an employee particularly likes and respects depart from the company thus depriving him/her of a relationship that makes sense to him/her.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">4. Difficult change of competences: The responsibilities of a person's position change to the point where his or her job no longer responds to the deeper interests or does not give him/her a meaning or a motive.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">What we should remember when considering why people are leaving is that people often leave for erroneous reasons. They leave without&nbsp;</span>really<span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;understand</span>ing why<span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;they are unhappy or what opportunities exist within the company with which they can improve things.

There are many ways and preventive measures that you should adopt and implement to prevent employees from leaving the company.&nbsp;</span></p><p>Some useful tips for tracking people that is to leave from your company:</p><p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Changes in employees’ behavior. The most indicative example is when employees go to work <span lang=\"EN-US\">delayed&nbsp;</span>or leave from their job early.&nbsp;</p><p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Decline in their performance.</p><p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sudden complaints from an employee who did not complain frequently.</p><p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Reports of exhaustion.</p><p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nostalgic references to other companies that an employee worked for in the past.</p><p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Alienation from their colleagues.</p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">If you find any ofthese really warning signs then&nbsp;</span>you should start to worry and take actions<span lang=\"EN-US\">.

		"description" : "<p>The balance between work and personal life is a big issue nowadays. Many people say enough with endless days of work, torn vacations, and nights spent in hotel rooms, and emails that take weekends from their boss. A lot of companies have received the message and responded properly by launching programs that help employees to balance the two sides of their lives.&nbsp;</p><p><span lang=\"EN\">Many entrepreneurs consider that any concession made for the purpose of reconciling work and personal life would correspond to significant costs for the companies and a burden to their finances. However, the balance between work and personal life can be modeled through a \"win-win\" perspective and not through a game with any effects.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN\">Work and personal life are not competitive but complementary priorities. In essence, they have adopted a philosophy that everyone wins. And they appear to be right. The new approach does not bring tangible benefits to both companies and employees individually.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN\">So, if companies want to maintain a good state in their businesses without exhausting their employees but rather keep them happy and pleased, they should read the following advice.&nbsp;</span></p><p>1. Ensure that employees understand the company's priorities and encourage them to be clear about their personal priorities: The company’s job must be done and the balance between work and personal life must not be an excuse to slip away. Alternatively, work cannot be an excuse to leave important personal slogans to slide. Directors need to be clear about the company's goals and performance. At the same time, they should encourage employees to be clear about their goals as members of a family and as individuals.&nbsp;</p><p>Once all these are done, programs and tasks can usually be customized in ways that meet both sides. The fact that these directors define business success based on the results is definitely essential. For them, the results count more than the process. On this basis, they provide their employees with specific goals but also great autonomy in how to achieve these goals. The combination ofemployees’ autonomy along with the determination of the goals and the expected results is a procedure that helps to be promoted a more flexible schedule for employees’ working hours.&nbsp;</p><p>2. Recognize and support employees as integrated personalities who have important roles outside the workplace: Directors can only handle the conflict of work and personal life if they understand and are interested in the extra-life lives of their employees. The sign of real interest creates a bond and gradually a sense of trust which brings to the company benefits that each manager anticipates.</p><p>3. Continually experiment with how employees perform the job: Smart managers know that production processes need to be revised and redesigned periodically for greater efficiency and effectiveness. The balance between work and personal life contains opportunities to experiment with these processes. In the descriptions of directors who have successfully implemented the work-life balance, conflicts between work and personal life priorities can indeed be catalysts for identifying work-related disadvantages that otherwise would be hidden.</p><p>These three principles should function as a guideline of each company in order to introduce programs that rejuvenate employees, relax them when needed and make them more productive to their job as they are able to strike a balance between the job and their personal obligations!</p>"

		"title" : "The reasons for maintaining employees",
		"description" : "<p><span lang=\"EN\">&nbsp;Maintenance is the opposite of renewal. Maintaining is not just a matter of good atmosphere. Maintaining good employees is important for three main reasons: it increases the company’s intellectual capital, the causal relationship between the employee's permanence and customer satisfaction, and the candidate's renewal costs of employees.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">In the industrial age, the capital stock of a business, such as factories, machinery, and land, determined how efficiently a business could compete with other companies. In our knowledge economy, intellectual capital is what determines the competitive advantage of a business.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Spiritual capital is the only knowledge and experience possessed by a company's workforce. Today, successful companies stand out with their innovative ideas and leading products and services that stem from employees' knowledge and experience.&nbsp;</span>Indicative e<span lang=\"EN-US\">xamples of people with intellectual capital include computer programmers, network engineers, technical designers, accountants, and direct marketing analysts etc.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">So, when employees leave, the company lives up to their knowledge which is gained with persistent effort and their skills that are often expensive to buy. When these employees go to some competitors then the loss is worse. Your business not only lacks a substantial part of its foundations but it's gained by your competitors without having invested time and money in employees’ education.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Now, everyone realizes that the satisfaction of the customer is one of the most important factors, if not the most important, for the survival and the development of an enterprise. This is another reason that keeping employees is so critical. Employees who are satisfied with work and the company are more likely to satisfy their customers. The attitudes of employees adversely affect customer satisfaction. The high degree of staff renewal reduces customer satisfaction and business revenue.</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">To the extent that business employees understood their duties and the company's strategic objectives, it has a direct impact on their attitude and behavior.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Thus, the bond of the employees entails the link of the client. When employees feel connected with their company, they are more likely to share with their customers their insight and feelings about the company. When customers are exposed to positive expressions for the company, they respond well to it.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Respectively, the high cost of staff renewal is the third main reason that retention is important. Employee renewal involves types of atrocious cost from which its heds the company's final profits.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">The direct costs including disbursements for attracting, joining and educating replacements.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">The indirect costs, such as the impact on tax on morale and customer satisfaction.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">The opportunity costs including the lost knowledge andt he work that is not performed during the period when executives and other employees focus on filling the vacancy and adjusting the company's replacement.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">The costs of losing and replacing an employee depend on the individual and the industry employed. Rarely this cost is low. The cost of losing a most efficient employee is obviously much higher than the cost of losing a common employee, even if the salary and benefits of both are the same. There is also the other side of the currency of renewal costs.</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">Renewal of inadequate people may not create any heir since the withdrawal of such employees may, in fact, eliminate some hidden costs. The price goes up as we look at the deficiency in senior management levels. And what are the costs that you associate with the low morale and the kickbacks they cause? No</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">one</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">can</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">guess</span><span lang=\"EL\">&nbsp;.</span>.....</p>"

They see it as the best and some carriers the only way to find solutions. Similarly, mathematics considers fun. These people do not hold positions that reflect this lifelong ingrained interest.

To locate people with this particular interest, look for those who are thrilled by cash flow, sales forecasting methods and other number-based activities. If a commercial manager is more interested in analyzing customer data than what is said in a queue group of customers, then he is likely to be a quantitative analyst.</p><p>For some people, nothing generates more enjoyment than thinking and mixing for abstract concepts. People with this interest can be thrilled by the development of business models that explain competition within a particular industry or analyze the competitive position of a business within a particular market.

They are also less interested in the features of the products that are already in circulation and more about anything new on the market.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN\">Counselors and mentors love to teach.

They are delighted when they have the power to make decisions. A person with such lifelong interest wants usually to be the CEO</span>.</p><p>It is much easier to help employees acquire or enhance their knowledge and experience than to make them feel ever lasting passion for their job. Of course, knowledge and experience play an important role in matching the right person in the right place.

		"title" : "Retaining the employees that benefit your company",
		"description" : "<p>In this article, we will present you some tips that will help you to retain employees that can enhance your company’s performance and the company’s operation efficacy.&nbsp;</p><p>1. <span lang=\"EN-US\">Do have a good start with new employees: Ensuring agood start is done by hiring people who are fit&nbsp;</span>to<span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;the intended position and ensuring that they perceive adherence to the culture of the company, as well as the details of its placement their work.&nbsp;</span>A g<span lang=\"EN-US\">ood attitude is also</span> achieved<span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;by setting new employees which makes them feel welcome as members of the team</span>.</p><p>2. <span lang=\"EN-US\">Create an excellent environment with</span> supervisors that employees' <span lang=\"EN-US\">respect: Managers often think that the company's policies and culture define the work environment. They define it to a certain extent.&nbsp;</span>However,<span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;policies can be circumvented. Whatever the atmosphere</span> is<span lang=\"EN-US\">, the company's culture as a whole</span> is also important<span lang=\"EN-US\">.&nbsp;</span>Bad supervisors <span lang=\"EN-US\">do not promote an excellent environment. How many of your unit's managers or superiors are being disliked by their e</span>mployees<span lang=\"EN-US\">?</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">How many have outbursts of rage&nbsp;</span>or<span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;blam</span>ing <span lang=\"EN-US\">others for their own successes, or they never say \"Thanks, you did a good job\". If your directors or supervisors are unpopular, be sure that each employee with tradable qualifications will leave. Ultimately, it is better to replace bad managers and vice versa to replace an endless number of employees.</span></p><p>3. <span lang=\"EN-US\">Share information:</span> Having employees access to all <span lang=\"EN-US\">information&nbsp;</span>needed <span lang=\"EN-US\">shows that you trust them, that they are important partners</span>,<span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;and that you respect their ability to understand and contribute to the business as a whole.</span></p><p>4. <span lang=\"EN-US\">Give&nbsp;</span>to <span lang=\"EN-US\">people as much autonomy as they can handle: Many&nbsp;</span>employees <span lang=\"EN-US\">like to work with minimal supervision. So</span>, <span lang=\"EN-US\">give people as much supervision as they can handle. In this way</span>,<span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;you will make them happier while making your own managerial work easier. Ask a team to explore a new market on its own or solve a business problem</span>.</p><p>5. Challenging your employees<span lang=\"EN\">:&nbsp;</span>Usually,&nbsp;employees<span lang=\"EN\">&nbsp;enjoy the challenge and the feeling that you trust</span><span lang=\"EN\">&nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN\">them</span>. <span lang=\"EN\">So</span>,<span lang=\"EN\">&nbsp;place the people you want most to keep on projects&nbsp;</span>and urge<span lang=\"EN\">&nbsp;them&nbsp;</span>to <span lang=\"EN\">overcome</span> their abilities, simultaneously supporting them in their attempt.&nbsp;</p><p>6. Provide employees with flexibility: Managers know that minimal working arrangements help to keep workers alive. Flexible work schedules and telework were effective in enhancing retention. Of course, not every manager has the power to introduce completely new working patterns. Nonetheless, almost everyone can afford some flexibility depending on the situation allowing employees to arrange their work, to take care of a sick child or to go to a doctor appointment. Today<span lang=\"EL\">'</span>s&nbsp;employees&nbsp;with&nbsp;many&nbsp;obligations&nbsp;appreciate&nbsp;such&nbsp;flexibility<span lang=\"EL\">.&nbsp;</span></p><p>7. <span lang=\"EN\">Design&nbsp;</span>cautiously the <span lang=\"EN\">jobs to encourage employee retention: Nothing is more&nbsp;</span>boring than when <span lang=\"EN\">the same things are repeated</span>. <span lang=\"EN\">So</span>,<span lang=\"EN\">&nbsp;if you see unacceptably high refresh rates in a critical category of posts, look at exactly what you ask people to do every day.</span><span lang=\"EN\">&nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN\">You may be able to&nbsp;</span>resolve<span lang=\"EN\">&nbsp;the problem of refreshing by redesigning the job: adding variety to repetitive work, by injecting case-staffed employees into workgroups, subtracting their interest, etc. If a job involves one or more repellent jobs</span><span lang=\"EN\">&nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN\">consider removing them or outsource them.</span></p><p>8. <span lang=\"EN\">Highlight the possible spacers in time: The pleasant working environment and the excellent jobs are a matter of opinion, what fascinates someone can scare you anymore. You do not know how well you do in one case or another if you do not try it.</span><span lang=\"EN\">&nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">As a manager, you are</span> <span lang=\"EN-US\">working on a daily basis and share your views with your existing ones. Think about promoting your communication and tracking of absenteeism. This will help you locate possible distances and get timely responses. Make a</span>n<span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;interview by asking your&nbsp;</span>employees<span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;how they feel about the responsibilities they have been assigned, about company policies</span>,<span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;and the work environment</span>. Also, a<span lang=\"EN-US\">sk them for their personal goals, whether they feel part of&nbsp;</span>the <span lang=\"EN-US\">corporate culture or not what would they keep in the company</span>.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>"

		"title" : "The benefits of teleworking",
		"description" : "<p>Many companies have discovered that telework is an effective tool for achieving work-life balance. The term telework describes the work performed by employees in places other than their physical offices and is facilitated by electronic communications and the Internet.&nbsp;</p><p>In particular, teleworking is the use of telecommunication to work where necessary to meet the needs of the customer: whether it is your home office, a telework center, a satellite office, a customer's office, an airport bill, a room hotel, a local Starbucks, or from your office with a colleague located ten floors below in the same building.</p><p>Supporters of teleworking focus on significant cost constraints and benefits, such as lower real estate costs, greater worker productivity, greater employee loyalty and satisfaction, and lower staff renewal rates. While teleworkers themselves report that teleworking helps them to balance work and their personal responsibilities, it was argued that:</p><p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span lang=\"EN\">teleworkers spend more hours</span> on their job</p><p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;t<span lang=\"EN\">elework is more efficient</span></p><p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;grati<span lang=\"EN\">fication&nbsp;</span>and devotion to project demands are<span lang=\"EN\">&nbsp;increasing</span></p><p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;t<span lang=\"EN\">raining and retaining good employees is easier</span></p><p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;t<span lang=\"EN\">he balance between work and personal life is easier to achiev</span>e</p><p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;r<span lang=\"EN\">esource</span>s are<span lang=\"EN\">&nbsp;sav</span>ed&nbsp;by <span lang=\"EN\">the company due to lack of realestate costs</span></p><p>Nonetheless, t<span lang=\"EN\">elework does not fit into any company. Tele</span>working<span lang=\"EN\">&nbsp;is appropriate when companies</span>:</p><p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;focused on<span lang=\"EN\">&nbsp;new operating modes</span></p><p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span lang=\"EL\">offer&nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN\">service</span><span lang=\"EL\">s</span></p><p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;are <span lang=\"EN\">dynamic, non-hierarchical,&nbsp;</span>and <span lang=\"EN\">technologically advanced</span></p><p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span lang=\"EN\">c</span><span lang=\"EL\">are c</span><span lang=\"EN\">ommands</span><span lang=\"EL\">&nbsp;driven</span></p><p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;are <span lang=\"EN\">willing to invest in media and education</span></p><p>Teleworking also requires the adjustment of directors and supervisors. Directors must concentrate on results rather than on activities. This means setting clear targets for each teleworker, ensuring that they understand these goals, and setting up a system to control progress on a short-term basis. Directors need to find ways to integrate teleworkers into the broader set; otherwise, the latter can isolate themselves and not be in touch with developments. Teleworking is clearly a new challenge for directors, but it has significant benefits, particularly in terms of saving work and balancing personal life.</p><p>Another great advantage of teleworking is flexible working hours. <span lang=\"EN\">Flexible working hours are a mechanism t</span>hat<span lang=\"EN\">&nbsp;helps workers achieves a balance between work and personal life. Flexible hours allow employees to work different hours from the usual. This enables people to work even when they look after their young children, their relatives,etc.<br></span>The flexible working hours can take many forms, such as training hours, reduced hours, home-day work, and programmed hours. Particularly:</p><p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span lang=\"EN\">Training hours: For example, a</span>n employee can work<span lang=\"EN\">&nbsp;from 1 to 5</span> hours while3 or 4 hours could be devoted to learning new things that contribute to increasing the efficacy of their job.&nbsp;</p><p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Reduced hours: For example, a working mother could work from 1 to 6 hours so as to fulfill the need to go her children to their school every morning.&nbsp;</p><p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span lang=\"EN\">Home-day work: For example, a tax consultant works for&nbsp;</span>about <span lang=\"EN\">6 hours a week in the period from January to April to meet the increased need to file&nbsp;</span>clients’<span lang=\"EN\">&nbsp;tax returns and 3 hours a week for the rest of the year</span></p><p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span lang=\"EN\">Programmed Hours: Fore xample, computer technician</span>s<span lang=\"EN\">&nbsp;to deal with the weekend with the theatrical group devote 4 hours from Monday to Thursday leaving vacancies on Fridays for rehearsals.</span></p><p>Flexible working hours are valued by many workers. Even more importantly, they enlarge the pool of candidate workers. If you define very closely who can work here on a nine-to-five basis from Monday to Friday, then a lot of qualified people will be automatically excluded</p>"

		"title" : "Quality management in the business competitive environment",
		"description" : "<p><span lang=\"EN\">Improving quality in products and services is a fundamental component of businesses’</span><span lang=\"EN\">&nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN\">modern competitive strategy. Businesses that are firmly committed to improving quality develop an essential culture alongside a good reputation.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN\">First of all, the entrepreneurial spirit (in its proper manifestations) is vital. It is necessary to find the golden incision that puts the most modern approaches of management in the service of entrepreneurial spirit, something that can lead to very strong competitive advantages. Many enterprises in developed economies that apply the latest in management, are trying hard to boost the entrepreneurial spirit of managers and their employees.</span></p><p>Secondly, the clients and their needs and desires must listen carefully. Let’s not forget that many businesses have not even begun to move towards this goal. But that's just the beginning. Marketing without the best value product or service is doomed in the long run.&nbsp;</p><p>All companies that are virtually missing from the international competitive game do not have to fall into the trap of irrepressible and defensive marketing. On the other hand, the rules of the international competitive game have already been written by others.<span lang=\"EN\">&nbsp;On the contrary, it has the trumps needed for innovation, a movement initiative, a daring for new, better products. Not</span><span lang=\"EN\">&nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN\">just</span><span lang=\"EN\">&nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN\">for&nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN\">good&nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN\">or&nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN\">cheaper</span>\r\n<span lang=\"EN\">products.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN\">Competition leads to a comparison of forces which protects the common interest, ie the mere consumer from the creation of monopolies</span>. <span lang=\"EN\">Competition between existing companies can be manifested in a number of ways, such as price competition, newproducts, customer service levels, warranties, advertising and better wholesale distributors' networks. It is therefore extremely important tohave health</span>y<span lang=\"EN\">&nbsp;conditions of competition in an economy.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN\">Therefore, the key factors for increasing competitiveness are&nbsp;</span>the p<span lang=\"EN\">roper staff training&nbsp;</span>and the proper o<span lang=\"EN\">rganization&nbsp;</span>of businesses’ activities. The good organization relates to the o<span lang=\"EN\">rganizational capacity of the company</span>, h<span lang=\"EN\">igher information systems</span>, t<span lang=\"EN\">he ability to respond rapidly to shifts in market conditions</span>, the<span lang=\"EN\">&nbsp;accurate technical assistance</span>, and use s<span lang=\"EN\">mart advertising.</span><span lang=\"EN\">&nbsp;</span>Respectively, <span lang=\"EN\">compan</span>ie<span lang=\"EN\">s</span>’<span lang=\"EN\">&nbsp;staff should be well trained and work in harmony with managers to provide high quality services with a smile</span>, <span lang=\"EN\">have&nbsp;</span>e<span lang=\"EN\">xperience&nbsp;</span>in<span lang=\"EN\">&nbsp;a given technology</span>, p<span lang=\"EN\">roduct innovation capability</span>, the a<span lang=\"EN\">bility to use theInternet&nbsp;</span>and <span lang=\"EN\">manage the various business activities</span>, and have s<span lang=\"EN\">ales</span><span lang=\"EN\">&nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN\">skills</span>.</p><p>In other words, good quality control expertise and attractive identification are applied. Finally, an element of good organization is the ability to bring new products to the market quickly as well as low distribution costs. The quality of the services alone is not enoughto create a competitive advantage. The most important and successful factor is the ability of a company to add value to the consumer in relation to the value attributed to it by the rest of the competition.</p><p>So, in order to be competitive and offer services that are accessible to customers, businesses must be able to follow some basic steps that are:</p><p>1. A business is required to put in place appropriate mechanisms to be able to capture customers' expectations of product quality, quality of service and reasonable delivery rates.</p><p><span lang=\"EN\">2. Customer expectations are always determined in relation to the alternatives proposed by the competition.&nbsp;</span></p><p>3. Customer expectations are dynamic. This means thata survey simply translates customers' views at a time.</p><p>4. Product quality and quality of service should extend to all channels of products’and service’s’ distribution</p><p><span lang=\"EN\">For an enterprise that wants to be considered committed to customer service, it must be able to translate consumers' needs, desires, expectations, offer of a product, which should contain much more than the product which is perceived by the consumer himself.</span> It is very difficult to think of a productthat is not accompanied and not supported by service components.</p>"

		"title" : "Allocate your marketing communication budget",
		"description" : "<p>The marketing communication budget allocation of any project needs to be determined and selected the media that has the minimum costs with the higher profits and benefits for the company in terms of quick message dissemination and consumer’s attraction. For this reason, quantitative and qualitative media planning should be organized. An appropriate allocation method is to combine both traditional and digital media so as to balance the benefits and the risk of the company’s strategy by developing good communication with the targeted customers.&nbsp;</p><p>The main goal of such an investment is to raise awareness about the product/service benefits, highlights the brand, create a professional image of the company, and inform the customers about the products so as to increase sales. As a matter of fact, the overall available budget should be defined with the propose to be allocated in communication activities based on the above criteria, taking into consideration the budget of previous years so as to measure their usefulness and enhance them with new ad ventures hopefully improving the quality and the efficacy of the communication strategy.&nbsp;</p><p>Traditional media can help to achieve companies’ profitability by increasing sales volume because they transmit messages relating to the particularities of each product, while digital media contributes to ameliorating brand equity and the involvement of customers.&nbsp;</p><p>In particular, digital media is more appropriate to expand product’sspecification, because it offers a strong interaction between the company and customers who are able to give feedback, answer to questionnaires in websites, provide suggestions for product improvement etc. Armed with these tools, digital media can influence the beliefs and the customer’s attitudes about the product and establish a trustworthy relationship between the consumers and the brand. As complementary to the above purposes, the traditional media should also implement at a half percent for customers that are not fond of the Internet.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, the digital media serves to increase brand awareness and company’s image due to the advent of the rapid pace of the technology and a lot of people that they use them. So, for products that belong to the growth or early maturity phase of LPC digital marketing is more preferable as it engages customers into product’s promotion. Besides, through the available online platforms, in which customers can interact with each other and communicate with representatives of the company, the company may achieve a better interface with its customers, as the latter understand that the company try to meet their demands and want to satisfy their needs eventually leading to building strong bonds of trust with the brand. &nbsp;Moreover, people exchange experiences about the brand, companies start to have funs, followers and thus its reputation is expanded a lot globally.&nbsp;</p><p>Aligned with this, traditional media can have a counter balancing function and companies should invest less money in it so as to be achieved brand visibility for those that are not involved in the digital market.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, it is suggested that it should be allocated from $400 to $10,000 to branding, $3,500 to $15,000 in websites, $1,500-$4,000 to social media, $300 per month to $3,000 in ad content, and $250 to $1,000 to events and $500 to $800 in traditional media. In general terms, new companies could allocate 12 to 20 percent of its gross revenue on marketing, while established companies between 6 and 12 percent of their gross revenue. Another interesting approach is to create a &nbsp;“safe” budget which includes 70% of the budget be allocated to “tried and true” channels, 20% allocated to “safe bets”, and 10% allocated to “experimental”. Undoubtedly, all these values should be examined according to the objectives of the company and the prime areas that they want to focus more</p>"

		"description" : "<p>In operation management, structural decisions play an important role in succeeding a business.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>However, much of this attempt may entail putting a great effort on behalf of managers to coordinate the available companies’ resources and the dynamic of the workforce.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>On the other hand, design thinking is a solution-based approach that promotes the idea of simplicity as the essential element of business success.</p><p>In particular, in the last decades, the design thinking is gaining in popularity as there are numerous examples of prestigious companies that follow this path with exquisite outcomes. This is because design thinking drives marketers’ consideration not only on how to ameliorate the products’ benefits or improve customers’ product perception but also on creating a visualized approach. This approach is human-centered since it puts the creativity at the forefront of the marketing plan.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>To be more specific, design thinking refers to a method of meeting people’s needs and desires in a technologically feasible and strategically viable way which requires the active participation of customers and rapid prototyping.</p><p>The design thinking involves particular steps that managers should follow.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>The first step includes the empathic understanding of the problem and customers’ needs which entails a lot of research on that.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Second, it is imperative to be defined the problem by analyzing the data that gathered in the first stage, while the third stage which is the most important, involves the generation of many ideas. In this step, managers visualize the problem using a human-centered approach meaning that they examine the human needs. To do this, they start thinking about ideas and the alternatives that they have to approach the problem. In this context, it has expressed some valuable ideation techniques that help the managers to more innovative and creative, such as the Brainstorm, Brainwriting, Worst Possible Idea, and Scamper method. The fourth stage is experimental and includes the prototype procedure in which the solutions apply in a small sample of users with the view to re-examining their efficacy concerning the reactions of the users with the product or the service. Therefore, the potential problems are detected making the evaluation of each idea feasible. Finally, the solution that is selected tests in a broader range of users, so that to identify the perception of the people about the invention and their feelings about it enabling the “inventor” to choose the preferable alternative.</p><p>&nbsp;So, it can be said that design thinking is the most pioneering idea expressed in the context of operation management because it solves customers’ everyday problems and satisfies their daily needs. Besides, if we add to this that the rapid rhythm of life makes things being very complicated, it becomes obvious that customers do not want to be involved in extra and sophisticated procedures.</p><p>This inclination urges customers not to experience the same things that dealt with daily but to test something new and convenient that makes their life better as the simplicity is what they are really looking for.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Apart from that, simplicity becomes a competitive advantage for companies if we take into account the other numerous benefits that design thinking offers. To be more specific, simplicity reduces the costs of manufacturing a product or deliverer services since there is no need for extra expenses for the amelioration of the featuring design but only for imaginary thinking<strong>.</strong> That is to say that, instead of finding distributional channels or intermediaries to process the products, managers can create new experiences and approach the clients through beginning fruitful conversations with the customers.</p><p>Therefore, simplicity ensures customer retentionand their loyalty as customers feel that the company is close to their needsand can meet their expectations.</p><p><br></p>"

This is inevitable since leaders should be able to adapt their behavior to different circumstances and administrate employees’ behaviors that embrace different cultural perceptions.&nbsp;</p><p>To do this, the main cross-cultural competencies that leaders should have are relational skills, harmonizer skills, and adaptability skills. Cultural intelligence skills help leaders to better guide the employees, improve their jobperformance, and establish a cross-cultural strategy that makes easier to be applied in the change management process. Also, understanding the cultural differences between the employees and knowing the ways in which employees should adjust their behavior accordingly to circumstances creates better working conditions and enhance the communication between the leaders and employees; ultimately ensuring not only the employees’ well-being but also greater profitability on their work.&nbsp;</p><p>Apart from that, leaders, who are aware of the cultural intelligence procedure, have the ability to resolve effectively potential conflicts that emerge among employees with different cultural backgrounds as they are great negotiators and function as the best harmonizers. These skills are of paramount importance, given that nowadays; multinational organizations operate all over the world, and leaders and employees should cooperate with people that have different cultural perceptions which sometimes may contradict.&nbsp;</p><p>As a matter of fact, finding a code of communication is very crucial and it is the leaders’ responsibility to ensure and establish a common ground between employees by acting as a model of behavior and by explaining to them the steps that should be followed so as to become culturally sensitive. To achieve this, leaders should first understand and embrace the cultural diversity in order to inspire employees to follow in their footsteps and making them easily involved in cultural training programs that they are sometimes boring for employees.&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, cultural intelligence skills and skills related to self-awareness and metacognitive knowledge are also essential in evaluating employees’ actions concerning cultural situations and interpret these results so as to measure the effectiveness of the strategy applied by them and whether there is a need of changing or adjusting specific behaviors.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, given that leaders should cooperate with many and different personalities, it is imperative to feel confident about their leading skills and methods so as to be a source of inspiration of them and facilitate their mimic process.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, cultural intelligence is a very important component of leadership due to the fact that gives a deep insight into the strategies that should be adopted so that employees adjust their behavior to the ever-changing market conditions.

And that's the type of workforce that high-ranking executives face in many parts of the world. From age and gender, to part-time and full-time status, ethnicity, race, sexual orientation and physical ability companies benefit from the differences between employees. Uniform strategies for maintaining good staff simply do not work anymore. Companies can improve employee retention rates by formulating creative and specialized strategies for every major part of the workforce.</p><p>The members of the temporary workforce, part-time workers, project promoters and temporary workers provide some important advantages, as well as challenging managerial and human resource departments.</p><p>The main advantages include:</p><p>· Exhibition, as companies can personalize the timetables of these employees to deal with their current workflow and demand by using them only when they are charged.</p><p>· Economic capability as businesses employing temporary agents, part-time workers, or freelancers spends money on payroll taxes, health insurance, and other costs.</p><p>Challenges include:<br><br></p><p>· A high degree of renewal that introduces unpredictability and instability into the enterprise culture</p><p>· High degree of commitment to the business and its products</p><p>· Increasing demand for the same benefits that regular employees enjoy, such as job satisfaction and career development support.</p><p>Because the extraordinary workforce is a valuable resource, many companies are currently developing programs specifically designed to maintain these employees.</p><p>Also, the younger workers, especially those aged 20 to 30, bring energy, vitality and advanced technology knowledge to the workforce of a business. Young workers are particularly keen to chart their career paths and take up a job that will help them advance to their next jobs.</p><p>Nonetheless, many new and young employees are very comfortable with quick changes and flat management structures from their older colleagues. This may create misunderstandings and tensions in the workplace between the two generations, especially when the presbyter and the immediate person come from different expectations of their work.</p><p>Many new employees want their employer to determine for them their progress - a career path that will gradually enable them to reach a level of pay that will enable them to maintain their new families. How can your business respond to the needs of newcomers, keeping the best of them?</p><p>&nbsp;You should first understand their background and personalize their work accordingly. Young people know about the contraction in the experience of their parents. They have accepted the reality that sometimes it is not certain in the business world. So, they believe in their own <span lang=\"EN-US\">skills. If there is a group for which modifying work or assigning a \"tire\" project is not just a good but necessary idea, this group is the inactive workers.</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN\">Also, employees that are above 50 years old need attention for two reasons. First, in some companies they represent a good percentage of employees. Secondly, mature workers have extensive knowledge and rich business experience, so they are a big part of the intellectual capital of each company. Many have qualifications, such as credibility, patience or impartial qualifications, acquired only through their daily, multiannual engagement in the performance of their duties.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN\">In order to keep these employees to your company, you may need to create a workplace where the usual practices in terms of job description, hours, earnings, and so on are removed. Remember these tips:</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN\">Ask mature workers what their needs are, give them flexibility, m</span>ake their work more interesting, and adjust the pay system.</p><p><span lang=\"EN\">Companies cannot scorn the talent they have because they are different from the rest of the people .Every talented employee is valuable and finding ways to stay in the company has business sense.</span></p><p><br></p>"

		"description" : "<p>Marketing-based employees’ retention strategy requires redesigning work personalization, strengthening social ties and hiring people with the least mobility. Linking employees who may leave with the job opportunities that appear within the company is still a clever tool in their quest to preserve them.</p><p>Another way is by adopting new salary plans. Those employees consider that remuneration is not a remarkable strategy for retaining staff. Remuneration is important in the sense that you cannot attract or retain the employees you desire if the latter consider their remuneration to be unfair or uncompetitive. Even people who are more interested in their profession and less money are aware of their own as an indication that the company values their connotation and their abilities. If they feel underestimated<span lang=\"EL\">,&nbsp;</span>they&nbsp;will&nbsp;leave<span lang=\"EL\">.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN\">However, remuneration is not a credible motive. Incentives often used by employers, including wage increases result in the best possible temporary improvement in performance. It is clear that other strategies are more adept at conservation issues. You must gradually pay out the bonuses you have <span lang=\"EN\">agreed. For example, bonuses are paid to the new CEO within 5 years.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span lang=\"EN\">Remuneration is of great importance. However, as a matter of keeping staff, it is easier to manage it more easily than corporate culture. Here are some strategies for setting up a proper pay system:</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN\">See what salaries your sector offers: You can assign this work to an advisory firm or apply the following economical options:</span></p><p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span lang=\"EN\">Locate registered adsonline</span></p><p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span lang=\"EN\">Get in touch with people working in search engines</span></p><p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span lang=\"EN\">Consult professionalc ouncils</span></p><p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span lang=\"EN\">Consider Internal Wage Disparities: Ensure that the pay for each job is broadly the same as that for similar jobs across the company.</span></p><p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span lang=\"EN\">Do not feel surpassed by your competitors: Just make sure that you can meet the most important needs of your employees</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN\">Redesigning the job isanother retention strategy. If you can identify those elements that satisfy but also embarrass a worker in a particular position, then you are able to completely remove the unpleasant places and assign them to other people whowill appreciate them. Think about it. What aspects of this work are unhappy with employees?<br>If we remove the unacceptable seating from that position, we should add something else to consider the position holographic and what is it?<br>Assuming that someone has to take up the unpredictable tasks which alternatives are there for their handling.<br>What does it cost more for the company, the redesign of the position or theexisting rate of renewal shown by this workplace?</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN\">Companies are almost always trying to match people with jobs. Written job descriptions and workplace scheduling analyze in detail the tasks and the rendered performance by dictating where, when and how the work will be <span lang=\"EN\">done. The expectation is that people will comply with descriptions of where, when, and how, which inreality can be highly arbitrary.</span></span></p><p><span lang=\"EN\">To understand the power of personalization, study the aspect of the economy for products and services. <span lang=\"EN\">In this area, competitive markets have led businesses to provide personalized up to a pointof products. Personalization is a powerful tool in any market where demand is less than supply, including the labor market. To personalize a job to meet the needs of both the company and the workers, think about what, where and how thisparticular position</span>.</span></p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"<p><span lang=\" en\"=\"\"></a></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>"

People with a C performance can run off a company and should therefore be removed into low-level positions where they can be eliminated in A-rated individuals. If they fail to improve on preparing for these new posts, they consider that the interest of the company would be to expel them.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN\">However, investing in people with moderate performance may worth. The only way to learn if such people deserve the attention of the company is by making an estimate of how much a company's performance would improve if it were able to promote a C-rated person to the next highest levels. What would be the cost in relation to the benefits? Are costs less than the benefits? If the cost outweighs the benefits, then the solution is either to move the person to a place where he or she can respond better or ask him/her to leave the company.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN\">An additional tip that I would like to remember is that you should not hurry to your assessment. You should be careful in examining the performance of your company and take the proper decisions that benefit your company and not only the company’s short-term goals.

Many keep their best form for trivial things. Keep the routine work for the moment you are tired.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang=\"EL\">4. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">Productive wait: Think about the time spent in <span lang=\"EN-US\">in waiting. Big things are accomplished at shortintervals. It is good to deal with things you do not particularly like.

That is why we have usually avoided setting a deadline for our work. Good tactics is to break big projects into smaller ones and until we feel comfortable we get started. This breakage helps to avoid in decision and overload. Set deadlines for smallerp rojects to meet the required time of the big one.

Avoid doing something important where much energy is needed to avoid mistakes.&nbsp;</p><p>7. <span lang=\"EN-US\">Do it Now: The fear of something grows constantly through imagination as it goes beyond the limits of reality. Preventive anxiety is worse than action. Ask yourself why you are late. There is a lack of information, a lack of self-confidence, a lack of stimulation or a starting point. Indecision is the greatest \"time thief\". Making it now saves time and effort. In the case of 95% lack of information there will be no better information in the future. If you need additional information, take a shot to get them</span>.</p><p>8. Organizing your place: A place for every thing and every thing in its place. Archiving saves time. Horizontal archiving is more effective than vertical. The mountain of papers in the office usually consists of things that you will decide later, you do not like doing it, you hope they will disappear, and they are difficult to be handled.</p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Following the previous rules will help to create the time you need to protect. If you are exhausted, it is unlikely to work effectively. Take care of yourself, find time to rest and do not face life as a continuous fight. No one wrote in the funeral plaque \"I would like to spend more time in the office”.</span></p><p><br></p>"

		"title" : "What are the elements of a good team leader?",
		"description" : "<p>There are some features that distinguish good from less good leaders and make them stand out. Regardless of where the leader works, small or bigger businesses, NGOs, or government agencies, the only sure thing is that when there is a set of people, someone needs to be able to - and have the right knowledge - to lead. Without underestimating the necessity of the team and the cooperation, there is no doubt that when good leaders are present, their presence benefits the whole team.<span lang=\"EN\">&nbsp;Especially nowadays, it is important to have personalities in companies that can inspire and guide properly.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN\">However, keep in mind that the team is not a group of people who work together but a set of people who trust each other. Trust is an emotion and cannot be demanded by someone or imposed. People trust each other when they share common beliefs, have the same code of values, and participate in the definition of companies’ vision because they feel that it is their own responsibility to make this vision a reality. When the vision exceeds personal benefits, the purpose is gentle.</span></p><p>So, good team leaders are distinguished by their ability to turn a set of people into a real team. They have the ability to function as a \"weight-loss triangle\" and maintain the quality characteristics of relationships within a group at a high level. &nbsp;For this reason, the coaching acts as a catalyst to illuminate black spots in the communication circle and empowers the team leader's empathy to understand behaviors and manage them creating not just balance but also stability that will lead safely to success. <span lang=\"EN\">Theymust have the ability to tame and curb the momentum of the team members who have the greatest potential and to speed up and strengthen the effort of the weaker members with the ultimate goal of eliminating the gap between them and creating a balanced climate. As a matter of fact, a good team leader is required to demonstrate skills, such as empathy, insight, immediacy, integrity, parity and speed of decision-making and problem management.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">G</span>ood team leaders envision not focusing only on the present but also looking at the future. They ask more than they answer. They listen more than they speak. They have no desires or wishes for the future but goals and they are familiar with the targeting process. In other words, they do not set blind goals but objectives that meet the vision.</p><p><span lang=\"EN\">They set together with their team the criteria of success and achievement of goals, so that the entire team can be recognized as a success. While this happens, they reward their team and celebrate with them. Good team leaders make timetables in planning towards achieving the goal, examining for each step what it can go wrong to be able to manage it better</span>.&nbsp;</p><p><span lang=\"EN\">Also, good team leaders should be able to understand the attitude of their team members correctly and objectively. And only with this, we can understand that the good team leaders are few and scarce. If there were so many who thought they were good, then thee cosystem of the business world would be different to the positive.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN\">Now let’ssummarize some points..&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN\">1. Leaders give the good example first. They lead by their behavior; they become the model that all employees want to imitate.<br>2. They constantly keep their team focused on the goal. They know where they want to go and communicate it with their team.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN\">3. They share with their team all their information and knowledge about how to do the job better.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN\">4. They reward without delay their associates - each member of the team - when they do their job well and much more when they surpass their expectations.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN\">5. They do not turn a blind eye when employees failed. They explain to them what they do not do well, immediately and clearly.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN\">Finally, successful team leaders cultivate an environment where all team members can collaborate harmoniously; an environment where each team member transcend himself/herself <span lang=\"EN\">and meets excellence, recognition and reward!</span></span></p>"

It is now seems as a necessary factor in search engine dominance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is now recorded that 20% of all search engine activities are based on voice search. This trend is also applicable to e-Commerce. Forbes reports that the current voice purchase market of $ 2 billion will grow to $ 40 billion by 2020.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This massive increase in market share will only continue as buyers accept Alexa-type voice assistants for their daily shopping activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Convenient shipping and collection of products</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With 40% of the total participation in the e-Commerce market, Amazon leads the way, especially in regard to logistics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The normal behavior of deliveries on the same day or the next day will be affected and change as companies compete to immerse as Amazon&rsquo;s customers first choice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There will be other changes that can benefit buyers like month monthly shipping subscriptions, unpaid programs, and &quot;buy online / pick up offline&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Augmented Reality</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As e-Commerce companies try to improve their sales techniques, augmented reality could become a successful tool.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of today&#39;s buyers use online stores to collect information about products, but a large percentage is still in favor of making final purchases in physical stores.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what guides this behavior? Online purchases involve uncertainty which is the factor to this behavior according to research.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When a person shop or buy in the internet, he or she cannot really see the actual item and they cannot touch it either. You have to use your imagination and fill in those blanks. For some buyers, that&#39;s good enough.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For others, not so much. With augmented reality added to an existing e-commerce site, companies can help their customers obtain a &quot;real-life&quot; product experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Giants like IKEA and Amazon already use these technologies, but we can expect this trend to extend to the medium and even to some small companies throughout 2019 and 2020.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Chatbots customer service</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although still underdeveloped in some parts of the world, customer service chatbots are reaching the spotlight with commercial and e-Commerce websites and we can expect to see more of this in 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, chatbots will be the first direct experience of many consumers with automation based on artificial intelligence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The similarities to human service make this chatbots capable to be on the same level of customer services guidance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where they fall short is in non-typical situations, and this can be potentially harmful to businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"embed-container-youtube responsive-video-embed\"><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/playlist?wmode=opaque\" width=\"640\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Jet Set Fly movement is really about you, we are inviting you to grow with us.

		"title" : "Customer satisfaction measurement systems ",
		"description" : "<p>The design of customer satisfaction measurement systems is a matter of particular specifications since the disclosure of results internally and externally raises a number of requirements that should be met. Let’s see eight points that are the main features of a successful customer satisfaction measurement system.</p><p>1. Emphasis on integrated measurement systems: Oneof the features of customer satisfaction measurement systems should be their integrated character. This means that the internal quality indicators assessed at the same time with customer satisfaction indicators and that allcustomers contact points are covered. An integrated quality indicator system includes both measurement and coordination issues between definitions, methodologies and implementation procedures on a case-by-case basis.&nbsp;</p><p>2. Developing valid methodological frameworks: Customer satisfaction measurement is based on valid methodological frameworks that are developed by specialized executives to measure customer satisfaction as well as link it to other business concepts, such as customer loyalty, and profitability. Customer satisfaction measurement is implemented on a number of occasions with\"discounts\" on the completeness and reliability of the methodology. This includes designing surveys, designing questionnaires, sampling, how to collect data, quality control of the survey and finally, analysis of the results.&nbsp;</p><p>3. Separation between design, implementation, and assurance of customersatisfaction measurement systems: In most cases, the development of customer satisfaction measurement systems is a result of collaboration between the quality directorates of the respective bodies, specialized consultants for planning and, finally, research firms undertaking the implementation of the surveys. Accordingly to each case, there are variations in the exact way this tripartite schemeworks, but in any case there is a clear separation between the discrete components of customer satisfaction measurement systems.&nbsp;</p><p>4. Emphasis on setting upcontact points between telecoms and customers: The measurement of customer satisfaction indicators should cover the presence of multiple points of contact between the business and customers. In most businesses, one can measure satisfaction metrics per contact point, such as pre-sale, sales, product and service provision, after-sales service, scheduled visits, and emergency service. It is also needed to add the need for different measurements in relation to the type of business customers.</p><p>5.Adjustment: Customer satisfaction measurement should not be based solely on \"global standards\" and so, in spite of the similarities between different systems, customer satisfaction measurement systems need to be adapted to each country and to any business. Also, customer satisfaction measurement systems are constantly adapted and updated to respond to ever-changing market conditions</p><p>6.Proactive - Timelessness: Customer satisfaction measurement should include proactive prevention issues before they become bulk and presented to the majority of business customers. In addition, measurements should be timely so that the firm to be able to monitor the evolution of its\"relationship\" with customers beyond and along with its sales progress.</p><p>7.Integration of the system into the general business culture: Customer satisfaction measurement should be integrated into the overall customer service plan, and therefore what is of great importance is the optimal use of measurements in the direction of improving customer service. This means practically that the development of customer satisfaction measurement systems, after a period of validity and dynamism, are policy tools inside the organization both for allocating resources to different agency activities and for targeting at the operational level and administrative units.</p>"

		"title" : "Employees’ exhaustion and how to deal with it",
		"description" : "<p>Exhaustion is the stress from work. Sometimes it is due to the individual but in many cases, it is the result of the culture that prevails in the workplace. Exhaustion usually occurs through lower job satisfaction, less commitment to the company, and increased willingness to do something different. In some cases, you will also see the following warning signs: reduced self-esteem, a decline in the feeling of being able to achieve it, and a neutral or negative attitude towards colleagues and customers.&nbsp;</p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Exhaustion is generally the result of long-term involvement in situations with negative characteristics, such as excessive workload, conflicting requirements, unclear objectives, monotonous work, interpersonal conflicts, minimal reward, minimal recognition of employee contributions, failure to achieve clear success.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Therefore, exhaustion is not only a function of the number of hours worked. Someone can work countless hours and still feel motivated. Unfortunately, most people runout when they feel more pressure and have no support in their working life.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Exhaustion can directly undermine your company's efforts to maintain your employees and if the company gets the reputation of exhausting its employees it will face the problem of not recruiting good employees. Even worse, the more active workers, ie those who are highly committed to their work are even more vulnerable to exhaustion.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Sometimes, some managers contribute to the problem of exhaustion without realizing it. Most tend to load all major tasks to the few people whose performance is top notch. And then when these successors accomplish it with one project, the managers immediately charge them with many projects.</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Some strategies to combat this problem are intelligent staff management, exhaustion management and tactical re-engagement of your top talents.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Intelligent Human Resource Management: One way to avoid excessive workload for employees is to create a long-term, staffed personnel management plan that ensures that there are enough employees who fit with the job. Here's how:</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">Have production supervisors to work closely to human resources and senior management in order to define a staff management strategy that meets the needs of the department and the company.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">Make sure that the staff is properly trained. People who are properly prepared for their work are more likely to be exhausted.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">Arrange the workload: If your department has a particular staff shortage and has no capacity to increase its potential, keep a strategy on employee requirements. Assess a job based on the value it adds to customers.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Managing exhaustion: Another way to avoid the high cost of excessive workload is to minimize managers the work-related stress. Here are some things that can be done:</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">Regularly check your workload, especially top-performing employees.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">Show your appreciation of the valuable workers.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">If a valuable employee shows signs of exhaustion, take a look at the job description. The positions and responsibilities of his/her position may exceed the capabilities of even an excellent employee. In these cases, talk to the human resources department and your staff by redesigning your job.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EL\">· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN\">Above all, be a shrewd observer and a goodlistener.&nbsp;</span></p><p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Re-attracting your top talent: Do not take your valuable employees for granted or suppose that they will always want to continue working for you. Remember that the job market for some specialties is quite profitable and provides great mobility for top employees. Consider that at times you have to reclaim these people. Identify people with top performance and then:</p><p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Remember to yourself that your best employees are a potential target of your competitors.</p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Show to your hired workers how much they appreciate them and give them little but essentially symbolic gratitude gifts or bonuses.</span></p>"

		"title" : "The Web as a distribution channel",
		"description" : "<p>The Web as a new form of distribution channel has revolutionized the methods of transmitted the goods from the supplier to the final customer introducing a new age in the field of marketing.&nbsp;</p><p>There are many advantages of using the Web asa distribution channel to the supply of the products and services. First of all, a Web distribution channel can approach many users and ship mass productsin different nations without having much expenditure. This entails a great expansion of the brand and an increasing number of customers who are aware of the companies’ facilities and its product’s benefits due to the brand promotion and advertising on the Web. In fact, Web allows people to have access to goods that cannot usually find in their own country, as most sites that sell goods ship them all over the world. Moreover, Web distributional channels reach new larger markets and contribute to the better collaboration between the companies leading to better prices and effective supply chain. Besides, it is commonly known that a company that is interested in expanding its operation in foreign markets needs significant consultation of the local distributors who are well-informed about the customer’s demand and preferences. Therefore, Web can be of their best assistant, as it eliminates the money waste and the time needed to approach such distributors so as to acquire important information.&nbsp;</p><p>Another benefit is that it functions everyday 24 hours a day; therefore increasing the possibility of augmenting its sales given that there are lots of people that prefer to buy online due to the lack of their free time. Also, the fact that manufacturers can cut down on retail expenses, make products available at a lower price than the price of products that launched in a shop. A direct consequence of this is the increased demand, as each company can target in a larger customer base taking advantage of this pricing strategy. &nbsp;</p><p>From companies’ perspective, Web facilitates the businesses to evaluate the resultsof internet marketing and measure the customer’s preferences by providing platforms that customers can give feedbacks or conduct research and measure traffic to the website. Hence, it becomes easier for a company to know more about the needs and habits of the consumers in a specific region and adjust its marketing strategies to them. Nevertheless, this knowledge and specialization are really precious to create a strong relationship between the company and the customers as it minimizes the consumers that feel left outfrom the distribution channel. As a matter of fact, companies do not need tocreate a new distribution channel but they can use the existed in which they invest a logic amount of money for that.</p><p>On the other hand, there are some particular disadvantages of using the Web as a distribution channel. One of the many disadvantages is that this distribution channel is usually very complicated and little flexible within its structure and for this reason, it creates delays within the distribution procedure. Due to the sophistication that it includes,it is very difficult for a company to supervise the selling environment and implement an alternative strategy if the customer’s habits change because they have not adequate and accurate personalized information. Also, it can pose potential channel conflict due to the multiple channels involved, something that needs a daily supervisor and activity so as to prevent misunderstanding, hacking about the product and the brand. At the same time, the Web needs many intermediaries who should be paid for these services leading to an increase in the product/service price which is burdened the final consumer. Moreover, they may have different strategic goals, a fact that may create conflicts during the distribution procedure causing loss of a harmonizer environment due to operational inefficiencies. This is because resellers are free to make changes to things injuring the image of the supplier.</p>"

In this attempt, the contribution of Big Data and Data Analytics can be an invaluable strategic resource for the organization. Exploiting data analytics tools, managers can make more accurate decisions as these decisions would be based on facts, quantitative research and not on suppositions. So, analytics is highly related to the decision-making process and constitutes not only a competitive advantage for the company but a strategic resource as well. Particularly, he expressed the notion that such competitive advantages can stem from the good use of business intelligence and predictive analytics. These tools are also well-implementable to every industry and every sector of the organization, such as marketing, operational department, quality management.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>However, to effectively use analytics, organizations should have Big Data and expertise people who can interpret them. Simultaneously, researchers have shown that companies used data analytics they should have the following characteristics: analytics supported a strategic, distinctive capability; the approach to and management of analytics was enterprise-wide; senior management was committed to the use of analytics, and the company made a significant strategic bet on analytics-based competition. Also, data analytics gives a competitive advantage to companies as data are cheaper to be collected comparing to previous years, there are useful tools that can interpret them without needing to invest a lot of money to infrastructures and there are people that can make this work and find the value that is hidden behind those data.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>For example, Internet of Things (IoT) assists companies to see their customers’ attitudes regarding certain products at a real-time base; hence giving companies the advantage to correspond quickly to customers’ behaviors. Apart from that, analytics can be used as an asset for companies since it provides a great chance for them to make extensive research concerning the market trends and the organizations’ operating activities, something that facilitates organization to see the sales trends, the improvements or the amendments needed to be done inside the organization, as well as the opportunities that emerge to the market. Also, organizations which exploit data analytics are able to innovate in the Market by making significant modifications in their processes or their products/services or by creating entirely new business models. This means that analytical practitioners are basically concentrated on operational improvements and strive to bring about data-driven innovations. Particularly, the most successful companies that used analytics exploit the artificial intelligence technology soas to increase the employees’ skills, save time from “big” projects and help managers to concentrate on the strategic details of the projects rather than involving managers to administrating processes demanded on such projects. Also, through this procedure, companies have the ability to detect and exploit new opportunities concerning their partnerships that can boost their business value chain. Along with this, companies that use data analytics, they increase their access to only useful data; hence saving time and money.</p><p><br></p><p>From the analysis above, it became more than apparent that data analytics contribute companies in miscellaneous ways, from resolving strategic issues to providing technological improvements such as cloud computing which ultimately concluded to acquire companies a sustainable competitive advantage.&nbsp;</p>"

		"description" : "<p>Establishing critical awareness of an organization’s culture is a difficult task that needs a coherent plan and persistence on the behalf of the manager and the leader of the organization. As it is stated above, one of the most popular ways to attain this is to be written all the values and the beliefs that the organization express by a mission statement and by establishing relevant rules. Without a doubt, transparency and clarity of the principles that incorporate an organization are very important so as to engage employees in its shared values and thus they should be expressed explicitly.&nbsp;</p><p>Another way to promote this is by creating effective communication networks that will enable managers to communicate with the employees and identify the assumptions that they have about the organization’s philosophy and the way that the organization operates. In this way, a manager can recognize the misunderstandings or the points that mismatch with the values of the organization and hence to make a try to harmonize the differences arisen. Simultaneously, employees will feel that our opinion is respected by the organization and they will be more willing to embrace different options and keep pace with the organization’s philosophy. In any other case, conflicts may arise.&nbsp;</p><p>As a matter of fact, through communication, employees can understand that diversity is a great benefit not only for the organization but for them also. Some authors also support that cultural awareness can be attained by applying holiday policies in which it will be recognized the diversity of the employees. This is one of the most effective ways to relax the employees, feel free and happy to acknowledge that the culture of the other person does not separate but brings together them.&nbsp;</p><p>What’s more, training programs are also pivotal for imbuing cultural awareness, especially for the new–hired employees, because they give the opportunity to employees to show which are the philosophy of the organization and the ways that this philosophy could be evolved in the future with the contribution of them.&nbsp;</p><p>Another effective measure that can be used is the “word tomouth” method that can be embellished by the stories disseminated across the organization concerning its cultural values. The paradigms and the success that knows the organization due to its cultural features reinforce the organization with a sense of proudness and urge them to follow the principles that characterize it.&nbsp;</p><p>Cultural awareness is one of the most important parameters that bring about the success of anorganization. There are many reasons for that. First of all, cultural awareness instills a sense of loyalty and unity between the organization and the employees. This, in turn, stimulates employees to make the most of them so as to be more productive and effective in their jobs as they are eager to show that they deserve the respect that the organizations display to them. Besides, it becomes more than obvious that when employees work for an organization and believe to its cultural values, they make the best that they can so as to achieve its goals because the organization’s success equals to the employees’success. Therefore, employees become more creative and inspired. Also, cultural awareness can eliminate potential mistakes that they can be made by the employees as these principals function as a guide to their actions.</p><p>Also, cultural awareness is very important to organizations’ success because it contributes to the customers’ &nbsp;loyalty. More specifically, a great many customers distinguish an organization from another exactly because each organization has a unique identity that expresses some values that match with the values that they have. So, being the employees aware of the cultural principles of the organization is very important in order to retain its fame and prestige.</p><p><br></p>"

This information is recorded in a report and presents the costs that a company expects if a particular (ideal or attainable) strategy is succeeded.&nbsp;</p><p>Standard costs of materials (standard quantity and standard price), labor(standard hours and standard rate), and overheads (standard rate and standardquantity) are values that helps decisively the budget determination process and the variance analysis, as they function as a starting point of companies’ financial performance evaluation which in turn facilitates the manager to achieve better costs controlling and a restriction to variances; for this reason it is prepared before the other cost analysis procedures in relation to expected operation conditions. In particular, the material costs are defined by the contracts that the company signs to buy the raw materials in relation to the inflation, while the labor costs are set from the contracts between the employees and the company, as well as from the legal rules that require the minimum level of wages so as to secure the rights of the employees. Also,overheads are predestined from the data acquired by companies’ previous experience adjusted to the inflation or from expected costs due to the operational changes. &nbsp;</p><p>The main purpose of standard costing systems is the arrangement of a company’s operating activities, as well as the efficacy of companies’ decisions regarding the number of costs and the company’s profits. To be more specific, standard costs are compared with the actual costs at the end of the fiscal year by applying a variance analysis. A successful managerial decision should be lead in a balance between the standard costs and the actual costs realizing the decision and the objectives that the company sets. Also, given that standard costs relates to the cost allocation, it can be used along with other costing methods, such as the job order costing system and the process costing system to appropriate allocate materials, work in process, and finished goods inventories with the view to simplifying costing procedures, encouraging cost reduction and fixing the company’s prices.&nbsp;</p><p>Another purpose ofusing standard costs is to ensure better financial performance in the long runby motivating and calculating employee’s and managers’ efficiencies. In fact, the standard cost report “communicates” with employees by giving them guidelines that should be followed. To be more specific, employees are able to be informed about the consequences of the lack of job performance and production efficacy and the rewards that will be given in the case of high job performance.&nbsp;</p><p>Simultaneously, it assists managers to apply the predetermined company’s strategy and facilitates the administration of human resources. Also, it is crucial for the production policy, as it contributes to being constructed a flexible budget, evaluates the dynamics of workforce and shows which are as are not productive. Finally, the standard costs prepare the managers and the employees to be ready for the actual production and informed about the strategy of the company enabling them to focus on a certain objective that should be achieved, hence facilitates their job and urges savings. However, the company should revise the standard costing reports at a regular base so as to see if changes emerged and thus alter the data given eventually achieving a better position for the challenges in the marketplace.</p>"

		"description" : "<p>(Water damage may seem harmless enough, however…it can be incredibly destructive to you and your home). Cedar Rapids, a wondrous place to be taken control by the waters beneath you. A place where you can get an adrenaline rush and enjoy something fantastic in order to make incredible memories. &nbsp;And yet, while you take on the rapids, there are safety measures that need to be taken. You need to sit carefully in your raft with a life vest strapped about your upper body. For rapids, beautiful as they are, can be very dangerous. The same can be said of the powers of property water damage. Water may seem harmless enough but left to its own devices it can be incredibly destructive to your home. Water damage can happen to anyone and at any time. But before it happens to you, take some simple measures to decrease the risk of sudden loss due to <a href=\"http://challisrestorationservices.com/water-damage-cleanup-cedar-rapids-3/\"><strong>water damage Cedar Rapids</strong></a>.</p><p>&nbsp;Update Any Drainage Pipes That Your Home Has: &nbsp;Make sure that your drainage pipes are up to date. When constructing or updating them, place the drainage pipes in such a manner that rain water falls through and ejects away from the home. Under no circumstances should you allow the drain pipes to release water close to the foundation. If so, you then run the risk of water weakening your foundation over time which can prove dangerous if left alone.</p><p>Install A Sump Pump: &nbsp;Are you having water issues mostly in the basement? Do they happen often? Then a Sump Pump will be of assistance to you. Choose a cast iron pump, and in case of a power outage, get a battery powered device as back up.</p><p><img class=\"fr-dib fr-draggable\" src=\"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/atg-storage-s3/assets/Frontend/images/article_image/feature_inside-072800000020191811080559.png\" data-error=\"0\"></p><p>Keep Your Doors And Windows Up To Date: When it is time to purchase new windows, make sure that you pick out windows which are water tight and thick of glass. If you wish to save money by not purchasing new windows, inspect the old ones; make sure that if any seams or cracks are visible, they be sealed and cleaned in order to restore their previous sheen.</p><p>Replace Your Pipes: &nbsp;Pipes for homes have a similar lifespan to humans when it comes to years: &nbsp;50-80 years. It is highly recommended that your pipes be replaced every fifty years. But, are you unsure of your pipes lifespan? Fear not! For a plumber will be able to access your pipes and inform you of their current age.</p><p>Every Year Give Your Roof A Thorough Investigation: &nbsp;Roofs are great objects which under most circumstances, provide an effective defense against the rain and snows of the heavens, who are responsible for many water damage instances. Regularly, at least once a year, check on the state of your roof. Are you missing shingles on your roof? Or does your roof possess damaged shingles? Then they would need to be replaced in order to keep your home up to date and safe from outside forces.&nbsp;</p><p>At Challis Restoration, our restoration professionals deal with <a href=\"http://challisrestorationservices.com/what-water-damage-restoration-companies-do/v\"><strong>water damage cleanup in the Cedar Rapids</strong></a> area day in and day out and most of these incidents are preventable.</p><p>if it so happens that your home experiences water damage.

It is attractive to the novice as it is a low-investment and a low-risk way of beginning your own business, therefore, does not feel like that much of a stake.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the quantity of the capital that needed to be invested in this business venture is just minimum; and it is also the best for someone that is already an owner of the online store with the inventory, but seemed to try out precise goods in the marketplace to see just how well it performs before you stock-up on it. If you are interested in discovering and learning more regarding this matter, there are some posts that you can check out about the best product ideas with the <a href=\"https://medium.com/@Jetsetfly/how-to-start-dropshipping-in-7-simple-steps-3c45e1893848\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">dropshipping tips</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For those that are expecting amazing margins just write off their bat, this kind of business model can be very disappointing. If the profit is your main interest then you had to be better off in going straight to this source&mdash;like the manufacturers&mdash;but these manufacturers don&rsquo;t always assist in the dropshipping. Since the dropshipping profit margins have been considerably lower in the comparison to some other business models like manufacturing and wholesaling, this dropshipping would probably not bode really well with the brand that is already a new beginning, since the business does not have the definite control when it deals with the customer satisfaction by branding and brand experiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img class=\"fr-dib fr-draggable\" src=\"https://yakkyofy-website.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/08/stencil.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Types of entrepreneurs which the dropshipping model will surely work well:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Budget Entrepreneur - dropshipping is absolutely the least costly method of vending products online, since you do not have to buy any inventory upfront. In this regard, the dropshipping system works really well for the entrepreneurs that have the limited budget or might prefer to keep the startup amount as depleted as possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First Time Entrepreneur v - this dropshipping form for online selling is also a good industry model for somebody that is just starting out their online selling. The fact is that selling online is not that simple. Driving traffic and switching that traffic for an average marketer will take a longer time to figure out and optimizing. Because of the lower costs connected with starting the dropshipping industry, it permits the new entrepreneurs to begin learning the chains of putting up the online store, driving the traffic and the conversion optimization just before investing thousands (and even more) in the inventory that you will get stuck with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Validating Entrepreneur - dropshipping may be the best means in testing the recent products, or even the new startup, just before heavily investing into the inventory that will not sell, making it the ideal business model for those entrepreneurs that required the highest level of industry and product validation just before the investment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Walmart Entrepreneur - dropshipping is for the person who wanted to sell a huge diversity of models and products. Depending on the price range of the products that you intend to vend, or if you wanted to sell thousands of different goods, it is nearly impossible without the massive funding to obtain all of that inventories. In this manner, dropshipping will be the proper model, since you do not need to buy inventory upfront.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"embed-container-youtube responsive-video-embed\"><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/hSle2L8hI8I?wmode=opaque\" width=\"640\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

		"title" : "3 Ways To Prepare For Business Fires",
		"description" : "<p>A fire at your place of business in Las Vegas affects everyone in your building and is one of the worst disasters that can happen to a business owner. <strong><a href=\"https://designbuildersconstruction.com/2018/09/27/commercial-fire-damage-las-vegas/\">Commercial fire damage in Las Vegas</a></strong> is devastating and must be planned for and prepared for by every business owner. As a business owner, you need to focus on fire risk assessment, fire prevention, and staff education so you can help reduce the risk of a fire occurring and help to mitigate the damage if it does.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Fire Risk Assessment</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fire safety codes must be in place for businesses. You should contact your local fire marshal and schedule a visit for your business so they can help you make sure safety codes are met, and an effective fire prevention plan is in place. Property managers should have a fire escape route clearly defined for the building, so be sure that it is posted in your work area. You can also use the National Fire Protection Association&rsquo;s website for further information and publications on the fire safety code for businesses. Keeping your place of business in line with fire safety codes will greatly reduce the risk of fires.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Fire Prevention And Protection</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Standard fire safety practices call for smoke detectors and fire extinguishers on every floor of the building. Automatic sprinkler systems are also a great tool to provide primary protection for your business in case of a fire. Emergency equipment kits should also be available in your workplace to provide items such as bottled water, flashlights, and escape masks to fight against smoke inhalation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Fire Safety Education For Staff And Employees</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Educating employees and staff on how to respond in the wake of fire will greatly increase the odds of everyone getting out of the building safely and quickly. Here are some ways you should educate employees about fire safety:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Have a fire escape plan in place, and make sure your employees are informed and rehearsed on how it works. Post the fire escape routes in areas that can be seen by all building occupants. Conduct a fire drill at least once a year to keep employees practiced and aware of the fire escape plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Designate an office fire safety and prevention officer. Their duties will include composing escape routes that are in compliance with the building manager, designate safe meeting points outside of the building, and offer scheduled fire safety training and education for fellow employees. They will also be sure that fire prevention information and practices are up to date and in compliance with business safety codes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Install an automatic sprinkler system in your building. Sprinkler systems are cost-effective and have proven to be the best way to fight the spread of a commercial fire. The National Fire Protection Association reported that properly installed and maintained sprinkler systems are 95% effective in commercial fires.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;Make sure all employees know how to activate the emergency response system in your building. Most commercial fire alarms alert local authorities and fire departments when they go off, but it is still good practice to be sure that all employees know how to alert emergency personnel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you find your commercial property damaged by fire or smoke, you can contact the professional fire damage restoration team at Design Builders in Las Vegas 24 hours a day! we also provides professional services for <strong><a href=\"https://designbuildersconstruction.com/commercial-construction/\">commercial construction in Las Vegas</a></strong>.</p>\r\n"

This story of mine is never shared to anyone, until one day, I decided to share my story to speak about e-commerce seminars and meet-ups in Miami.</p><p>When I was still going to school, I would like to prove to everyone that doubted me that they are all wrong about my dreams and ambitious goals. I know lots of people that considered what I was achieving with entrepreneurship are really a big JOKE.</p><p>To be specific, I had this buddy who for various reasons assists me with everything that I do in the field of academics, tracks, basketball, and a lot more.</p><p>But, when it is about starting my personal business and creating a brand, he was the one that had the most negative comments and doubts towards what I planned to do.</p><p>I even ended up making a bet and saying to him that I could achieve all these MASSIVE goals of mine, and I said that I would, when he said that I wouldn’t, and we even filmed it and even said that after 3 months we would look back at it together to see who was the right one, and I ended up attaining all of them!</p><p>I totally forgot about these not until one day after months had passed, I was scrolling the videos on my cell phone and saw it and I decided to send it to him, but there was no reply.</p><p>After another more 3–4 months since I have ever spoken to him and I take a random message like “Hey Josh, I am super pleased by what you had been doing, and I am so sorry for always speaking sh*t back in that day, just keep it up, man!”</p><p>I consider replying since I initially felt hostile due to the negative energy I welcomed months prior that, which I thought take me to grind. Recognizing my buddy for some years now, I also know that just like me that he adores to be right. And so I applauded him tremendously for making contact with me. It really takes a REAL good man for him in making that. And so after that 12 hours of reflecting, I finally responded to his message and let him identified how much I am grateful for him coming ahead and congratulating me after that 8+ month of my chores paying off.</p><p>Then after another 12 hours that passed, about 24 hours after his first message, I received a phone call from one of our old high school coach, telling me that “Josh, it is “your buddy” man, and he is dead… He got in a car accident and hit his head last night”.</p><p>My heart freeze-up and I felt awful however, I immediately looked at the positive circumstances that had to arrive from this negative vibe. Abruptly, “Proving people incorrectly, or making it for your haters” did not feel really good at all.</p><p>That emotion of proving people that they are wrong, which I thought take me to my accomplishment was really a bad feeling. Although we had that disconnection, but, that was my buddy and I can give up that “cause” 10 out in 10 times just to have him now and be back again. I will miss him, but I know that he is in a much better place now.</p><p>But, this instance has now changed my <strong>PURPOSE and my MISSION</strong>.</p><p><img class=\"fr-dib fr-draggable\" src=\"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/atg-storage-s3/assets/Frontend/images/article_image/feature_inside-10020000002018154351781.png\" data-error=\"0\"></p><p>I realized that I do not put out content, value, and act as firm as I can prove the people WRONG instead to prove the people RIGHT.</p><p>To discontinue the people who would have given up with themselves due to outside judgments or what the teachers, friends and parents, would say to disprove them, I will do what I need to do, so I may be able to inspire and educate those people in becoming the best that they may be for THEMSELVES and nobody else.</p><p>I really do this for the people that cannot and for the people that have permanently adrift their opportunity. Also for the people that need a little more belief within them. It is not about making it to prove someone WRONG. It is about making it to PROVE to them that YOU are RIGHT.</p><p>This is now one of the major reasons why I do what I am doing now. So I am setting out on a mission to transform the game forever:</p><p>Remember that what the others did in their life and in their career, then <strong><em>Team Jet Set</em></strong> is also doing it to Internet Marketing and E-commerce.</p>"

Strategies related to the sources of funds are important since it determine how financial resources will be made available for implementation of business strategies.</p><p><strong>Developing financial budgets/ statements:&nbsp;</strong>Projected financial statements is a central strategy implementation technique as it allows an organization to examine the expected results of various actions and approaches. There are several types of financial budgets used by different business enterprise. Some of this includes cash budgets, operating budgets, sales, capital, expenses and fixed budgets.

Net worth represents the sum of common stock additional paid-in capital and retrained earnings. After calculating the net worth, add or subtract an appropriate amount for goodwill and overvalued or undervalued assets.

This is done through business level strategies.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><em>What are Business Level Strategies?</em></strong></p><p>Business level strategies are the courses of action adopted by an organization for each of its business separately, to serve identified customer groups and &nbsp;this provides value to the customers by satisfying their needs. An organization gains a competitive advantage by exploiting core competencies in specific, individual product or service markets. In simple words Business Level Strategy is concerned with a firm's position in an industry, relative to the customers and the competitors.</p><p><strong><em>Who are the customers?</em></strong></p><p>Customers are the foundation of an organization's business level strategy. Knowing one's customers is very important in obtaining and sustaining a competitive advantage. Being able to successfully predict and satisfying customer needs in present and future is very important for any business enterprise. Perhaps one of the Tata's mistake in manufacturing Nano was understanding who was their real customers and what they wanted. So who will be served, what needs have to be met, and how those needs will be satisfied are to be determined particularly by the senior management.</p><p><strong><em>How to satisfy customers needs?</em></strong></p><p>Any business enterprise or an organization must determine how to bundle up the resources and capabilities to form core competencies and then use these core competencies to satisfy customer needs or create value for them. Business level strategy provides many advantages for a business enterprise in service market as well as every individual customer. Having selected a market, the organization must develop a plan to be successful in that market. Business strategy therefore looks at how the organization can compete successfully in the individual market that it chooses to operate within.</p><p><em><strong>How strategy is concerned with customer satisfaction? &nbsp;</strong></em></p><p>To meet the customer needs in any area of business over the competitors or in the market strategy provides the required help in meeting customers needs and provides advantage over other competitors. An organization using a successful strategy may concentrate on a particular group of customers and geographic markets better than competitors who serve a broader market.</p><p>In short Business Level Strategy is concerned with issues such as:&nbsp;</p><p>• Meeting the needs of key customers.</p><p>• Achieving advantage over the competitors.</p><p>• Avoiding competitive disadvantage.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <em>&nbsp;\" Get closer than ever to your customers.

Most of us would argue and ask “what else do we work for” or reply “we work for our own satisfaction and love for our career”. Say what?! Both are not true. Money does drive us and keeps us going towards our professional and personal goals. But money is not the only thing we work for. While money is essential for our survival, basic necessities as well as luxuries, we continue working a particular job in a particular place for various other reasons.</p><p>There are a few external and internal factors that influence where we work and how we work. We take up a specific field of interest, study, complete our degrees and get a job in the same field to work for. Here, we see that we work according to our interests and not some random jobs (in most cases). After we take up our job, the workload, the organisational culture and peer groups define our work and progress. These are a few external factors.</p><p>Every soul longs for a little recognition and appreciation. If the team leader or project manager keeps his employees motivated, they tend to work better. If the colleagues from office are encouraging, a person performs better. The benefits, holidays, office parties, bonuses also influence the employees inclination towards showing up at office and working towards the progress of his project successfully, indirectly profiting the company.</p><p>Some internal factors are interest in his field of work, satisfaction in finishing on or before deadlines, possessions he could buy from his/her salary, etc. All these factors ensure that a person is motivated at work and happy to do work.

Machiavellianism in psychology refers to a personality trait which sees a person so focused on their own interests they will manipulate, deceive, and exploit others to achieve their goals.</p><p>A few traits of a Machiavellian&nbsp;leader:</p><p>- The person is narcissistic. He/ she does not refuse photo-ops and handshakes.</p><p>-The person is very much involved with himself/herself. Thinks self-importance is a must.</p><p>- Very often, these kinds of people do not tell why they are doing something before they do it. Their reasons are very secretive and most probably, will beneficiate&nbsp;them more than the larger good.</p><p>- They are cunning and are good at manipulation. They know which keys to push. They often trade in words.</p><p>- Under no circumstance will they let go of their power even at the cost of not being loved, respected or hated.</p><p>Sound familiar?</p><p>Yes. Down to our topic! The President of the United States, Mr. Donald Trump seems to fit the personality traits of a Machiavellian. The 45th and current president of the US assumed office on 20th January 2017.

		"description" : "<p><strong>Auditing Business Strategy/Strategy Audit&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The audit of management performance with regard to its strategies helps an organisation identify problem areas and correct the strategic approaches that have not been effective so far. An assessment of the external environment shows where changes happen and where organisation's strategic management no longer match the demands of the marketplace. Based on such analysis, the organisation can improve business performance by periodically conducting such an audit.</p><p>Companies review their business plans and strategies on regular basis to identify weaknesses and shortcomings to enable a successful development plan. The strategy audit secures that all necessary information for the development of the company are included in the business plan and that the management supports it.</p><p>The core of Strategy Audit, for any corporate entity, lies on two important questions:</p><p>* How well is the current strategy working?</p><p>* How well &nbsp;will the current strategy be working in future?</p><p>* How can this be evaluated in present and future?</p><p>* How urgent is there a need to change the strategy?</p><p>For this, a periodic review and evaluation of the fundamental characteristics of a strategy are necessary.</p><p>In short a strategy audit ia an examination and evaluation of areas affected by the operation of a strategic management process within an organisation.</p><p>An advantage of strategy audit is that it provides an excellent platform for discussion with the top management regarding necessary corporate actions or changes in the existing business plan. It also identifies the need to adjust the existing business strategies and plans.</p><p><strong>Need of Strategy Audit</strong></p><p>A strategy audit is needed under the following conditions:</p><p>* When the performance indicators reflect that a strategy is not working properly or is not producing desired outcomes.</p><p>* When the goals and objectives of the strategy are not being accomplished.</p><p>* When a major change takes place in the external environment of the organisation.</p><p>* When the top management plans:</p><p>a) to fine-tune the existing strategies and introduce new strategies and</p><p>b) to ensure that a strategy that has worked in the past continues to be in-tune with subtle internal and external changes that may have occurred since the formulation of strategies.</p><p>Adequate and timely feedback is the cornerstone of effective strategy audit. Strategy audit can be no better than the information on which it is based.</p><p><strong>To conclude Strategy Audit includes three basic activities:</strong></p><p>1. Examining the underlying bases of a firm's strategy.</p><p>2. Comparing expected results with actual results, and</p><p>3. Taking corrective actions to ensure that performance conforms to plans.</p>"

On average it costs eight times the amount of money to acquire a new customer as it retains a current customer.</p><p>The simplest (and most cost effective) way to get new customers is to offer incentives to your current customers and motivate them to initiate referrals for you as well. &nbsp;Word of mouth is the most powerful form of advertising.</p><h3>&nbsp;3. &nbsp;<strong>Increase your Conversion Rate</strong></h3><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Generating new leads is an important part of business growth now &nbsp;Increasing sales conversion in your business is one of the fastest and lowest cost methods to boost your business profits.</p><h3><strong>4. &nbsp;Review Current Pricing Structure</strong></h3><p>Raising prices can be a terrifying prospect; however a small increase in your prices can make a significant impact on your gross profit in terms of economics.</p><p>Therefore, correct costing of your products and services is very important.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>5. &nbsp;Reduce your inventory</strong></h3><p>Stock control is a good way to streamline your business and improve cash flow.</p><p>With less money tied up in slow-moving inventory and fewer losses due to expired or discontinued inventory.

Putting up false claims is not only unethical but also illegal.</p><p><strong><em>Puffery&nbsp;</em></strong></p><p>Statements like “The world’s no.1 lipstick” or “India’s best coffee” all, come under the category of puffery. Puffery is very close to exaggeration.</p><p><strong><em>Unverified claims&nbsp;</em></strong></p><p>Products are advertised with many benefits and results that cannot be guaranteed or proved. Eg: Shampoos with guarantee longer and stronger hair do not tell the customers why and how the product works.</p><p><strong><em>Stereotyping women</em></strong></p><p>A sexist culture is encouraged in most advertisements. Women are being portrayed as sex objects. Dove soap, for instance, ran a widely seen ad campaign featuring “real” models. The ad was meant to promote realistic body images and encourage girls to love the way they looked even if they were not supermodels.</p><p><strong><em>False brand comparisons</em></strong></p><p>Comparing a company’s product with another company’s product and making false claims against the competitors might land them in legal disputes.</p><p><strong><em>Children in advertising</em></strong></p><p>Children are more prone to get carried away by ads. Children should not be targeted while a company advertises its products. Kids Channels should refrain from running harmful and leading ads. <strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p>"

		"title" : "BUSINESS PROCESS REENGINEERING",
		"description" : "<p><strong>What is a Business Process Reengineering?</strong></p><p>Business Process Reengineering (BPR) is an approach to unusual improvement in operating effectiveness through the redesigning of critical business process and supporting business system. It is revolutionary redesign of key business processes that involves examination of the basic process itself. It looks at the minute details of the process, such as why the work is done, who does it, where is it done and when it is done. BPR refers to the analysis and redesign of workflows and processes both within the organisation and between the organisation and the external entities like suppliers, distributors and service providers.</p><p>The orientation of redesigning efforts is basically radical. In other words, it is a total deconstruction and rethinking of business process in its entirely, unconstrained by is existing structure and pattern. Its objective quantum jump in process performance in terms of time, cost, output, quality and responsiveness to customers. So BPR is a revolutionary redesigning of key business processes.</p><p><strong>Steps involved in Business Process Reengineering:</strong></p><p><strong>Step 1. &nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong><em>Determining objectives:</em></strong> Objectives are the desired end results of the redesign process which the management and organisation attempts to realise. They will provide the required focus, direction, and motivation for the redesign process that helps in building a comprehensive foundation for the reengineering process.</p><p><strong>Step 2.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;<em>I</em></strong><strong><em>dentify customers and determine their needs</em></strong>: The process designers have to understand customers- their profile, their steps in acquiring, using and disposing a product. The purpose is to redesign business process that clearly provides value addition to the customers.</p><p><strong>Step 3.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong><em>Study the existing process:</em></strong> The study of an existing process will provide an important base for the process designers. The purpose is to gain an understanding of the 'what' and 'why' of the targeted process. However as discussed earlier, some companies go through the reengineering process with clean perspective without laying emphasis on the past process.</p><p><strong>Step 4. &nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong><em>&nbsp;Formulate a redesign process plan:</em></strong> The information gained through the earlier steps is translated into an ideal redesign process. Formulation of redesign plan is the real crux of the reengineering efforts. Customer focussed redesign concepts are identified and formulated. In this step alternative process are considered and the best are selected.</p><p><strong>Step 5. &nbsp;</strong></p><p><em><strong>Implementation of the redesigned process:</strong></em> It is easier to formulate new process than to implement them. Implementation of the redesign process and application of other knowledge gained from the previous step is key to achieve dramatic improvements. It is the joint responsibility of the designer and management to operationalise the new process.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Also, the efficiently redesigned business process provide a firm with many more opportunities for trying, testing, modifying and learning.</p>"

Competitive landscape is about identifying and understanding the competitors and at the same time, it permits the comprehension of their vision, mission, core values, niche markets, strength and weaknesses in the market places and helps it to choose and implement effective strategies that will improve its competitive landscape.&nbsp;</p><p>An in depth investigation and analysis of a firm's competition allows it to asses the competitor's strengths and weakness in the marketplace and helps it to choose and implement effective strategies that will improve its competitive advantage.</p><p><strong>Steps to understand the competitive landscape</strong></p><p><strong>1. &nbsp;Identify the competitor:</strong> The first step to understand competitive landscape is to identify the competitors in the firm's industry and have actual data about their respective market share.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;This answers the question:</p><p>&nbsp; <em>* Who are the competitors?</em></p><p><strong>2. &nbsp;Understand the competitors:</strong> Once the competitors have been identified, the strategist can use the market report, internet, newspapers, social media, industry reports and various other sources to understand the product and services offered by them in different markets.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;This answers the question:</p><p>&nbsp;<em>&nbsp; * What are their products and services?</em></p><p><strong>3. &nbsp;Determine the strengths of the competitors</strong>: What are the strength of the competitors? what do they do well? Do they offer great products? Do they utilize marketing in a way that comparatively reaches out to more consumers. Why do customers give them their business?</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;This answers the questions:</p><p>&nbsp; <em>&nbsp; * What are their financial position?</em></p><p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; * What gives them cost and price advantage?</em></p><p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; * What are they likely to do next?</em></p><p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; * How strong is their distribution network?</em></p><p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; * What are their human resource strengths?</em></p><p><strong>4. &nbsp;Determine the weaknesses of the competito</strong>rs: Weaknesses (and strengths) can be identified by going through consumer reports and reviews appearing in various media. After all consumers are often willing to give their opinions, especially when the products or services are either great or very poor.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;This answers the question:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<em>* Where are they lacking?</em></p><p><strong>&nbsp;5. &nbsp;Put all the information together:</strong> At this stage, the strategist should put together all information about competitors and draw inference about what they are not offering and what the firm can do to fill in the gaps. The strategist can also know the areas which need to be strengthen by the firm.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;This answers the questions:</p><p>&nbsp; <em>&nbsp;* What will the business do with this information?</em></p><p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp;* What improvements does the firm need to make?</em></p><p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp;* How can the firm exploit the weakness of competitors?</em></p><p>Having a competitive advantage is necessary for a firm to compete in the market. Competitive advantage from a firm's ability to perform activities more effectively than its rivals. But what is more important is whether the competitive advantage is sustainable. By knowing if it is a leader, challenger, or follower, it can adopt appropriate competitive strategy.</p><p><br></p>"

The business organisation can possess a large amount of information that help them in taking strategic and other important decisions. Companies that translate this information to knowledge and use it in their planning and decision making.</p><p>A benchmark may be defined as a standard or a point of a reference against which thing may be compared and by which something can be measured and judged. However, the term got popularity much later in seventh decade of twentieth century. Initially, the concept evolved in companies operating in an industrial environment. Over a period of time it covered other spheres of business activity. In recent years, different commercial and non-commercial organisations are discovering the value of benchmarking and are applying it to improve their processes and systems.</p><p><strong>What is Benchmarking?</strong></p><p>In simple words, benchmarking is an approach of setting goals and measuring productivity based on best industry practises. It developed out of the need of the need to have information against which performance can be measured.</p><p><em>For example, a customer support engineer of a television company attends a call with in forty-eight hours. If the industry norm is that all calls are attended within twenty four hours, then the twenty four hours can be s benchmark.</em></p><p>Benchmarking helps businesses in improving performance by learning from the best practises and the processes by which they are achieved. Thus, benchmarking is a process of continuous improvement in search for competitive advantage</p><p>Firms can use benchmarking practises to achieve improvements in diverse range of management functions, such as:</p><p><em>* Maintenance operations,</em></p><p><em>* Assessment of total manufacturing costs,</em></p><p><em>* Product development,</em></p><p><em>* Product distribution,</em></p><p><em>* Customer services,</em></p><p><em>* Plant &nbsp;utilisation levels,</em></p><p><em>* Human resource management.</em></p><p><strong>Steps in Benchmarking Process.</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;(i) &nbsp;Identifying the need for benchmarking:</strong> This step will define the objectives of the benchmarking exercise. It will also involves selecting the type of benchmarking. Organisations identify realistic opportunities for improvements.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;(ii) &nbsp;Clearly understanding existing decision making processes:</strong> This step involves compiling information and data on performances. This will include mapping processes. Information and data is collected by different &nbsp;methods such as interviews, visits and filing of questionnaires.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>&nbsp;(iii) &nbsp;Identify best processes:&nbsp;</strong>Within the selected framework best processes are identified. These may be within the same organisation or external to them.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;(iv) &nbsp;Comparison of own process and performance with that of others:&nbsp;</strong>Benchmarking process also involves comparison of performance of the organisation with performance of other organisation. Any deviation between the two is analysed to make further improvements. Feasibility of making the improvements in the light of the conditions that apply within the organisation is also examined.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>&nbsp;(v) &nbsp;Prepare a report and implement the steps necessary to close the performance gap:&nbsp;</strong>A report on benchmarking initiatives containing recommendation is prepared. Such a report also contains the action plans for implementation.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;(vi) &nbsp;Evaluation:&nbsp;</strong>Business organisation evaluates the result of benchmarking process in terms of improvements through objectives and other criteria set for the purpose. They also periodically evaluate in the light of changes in that conditions that impact the performance.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Benchmarking is not a panacea for all problems. Rather, it studies the circumstances and processes that helps in superior performance. Better processes are not merely copied. Efforts are made to learn, improve and evolve them to suit the organizational requirements.

		"title" : "RIVALRY AND SUBSTITUTES",
		"description" : "<p><strong>The Nature of Rivalry in the Industry.</strong></p><p>The intensity of rivalry in an industry is a significant determinant of industry attractiveness and profitability. The intensity of rivalry can influence the costs of suppliers, distribution, and of attracting customers and thus directly affect the profitability. The more intensive the rivalry, the less attractive is the industry. Rivalry among competitors tends to be cutthroat and industry profitability low when</p><p><em>(i) An industry has no clear leader.</em></p><p><em>(ii) Competitors in the industry are numerous.</em></p><p><em>(iii) Competitors operate with high fixed costs.</em></p><p><em>(iv) Competitors face high exit barriers.</em></p><p><em>(v) Competitors have little opportunity to differentiate their offerings.</em></p><p><em>(vi) The industry faces slow or diminished growth.</em></p><p><strong>(i) Industry Leader :</strong> A strong industry leader can discourage price wars by disciplining initiators of such activity. Because of its greater financial resources, a leader can generally outlast smaller rivals in a price war. Knowing this, smaller rivals often avoid initiating such a contest.</p><p><strong>(ii) Number of Competitors :</strong> Even when an industry leader exists, the leader's ability to exert pricing discipline diminishes with the increased number of rivals in the industry as communicating expectations to players becomes more difficult.</p><p><strong>(iii) Fixed Costs&nbsp;</strong>: When rivals operate with high fixed costs, they feel strong motivation to utilize their capacity and therefore are inclined to cut prices when they have excess capacity. Price cutting causes profitability to fall for all firms in the industry as firms seek to produce more to cover costs that must be paid regardless of industry demand. For this reason, profitability tends to be lower in industries (for example, airline, telecommunications) characterized by high fixed costs.</p><p><strong>(iv) Exit Barriers :</strong> Rivalry among competitors declines if some competitors leave an industry. Profitability therefore tends to be higher industries with few exit barriers. Exit barriers come in many forms. Assets of a firm considering exit may be highly specialised and therefore of little value to any other firm. Such a firm can thus find no buyer for its assets. This discourages exit. When barriers to exit are powerful, competitors desiring exit may refrain from leaving. There continued presence in an industry exerts downward pressure on the profitability of all competitors.</p><p><strong>(v) Product Differentiation&nbsp;</strong>: Firms can sometimes insulate themselves from price war by differentiating their products from those of rivals. As a consequence, profitability tends to be higher in industries that offers opportunity for differentiation. Profitability tends to be lower in industries involving undifferentiated commodities such as, memory chips, natural resources, processed metals and railroads.</p><p><strong>(vi) Slow Growth :</strong> Industries whose growth is slowing down tend to face more intense rivalry. As industry growth slows, rivals must often fight harder to grow or even to keep their existing market shares. The resulting intensive rivalry tends to reduce profitability for all.</p><p><strong>Threat of Substitutes.</strong></p><p>A final force that can influence industry profitability is the availability of substitutes for an industry's product. To predict profit pressure from this source, firm must search for product that perform the same or nearly the same function as their existing products. Real estates, insurance, bonds and bank deposits for example are clear substitutes for common stocks because they represent alternate ways to invest funds.</p><p>The threat of substitutes is great in many high tech industries as well<em>. For example introduction of digital filmless cameras virtually replace the film cameras and threatened the existence of Eastman Kodak and Fuji Film. Further, the introduction of smart phones has replaced cameras to a great extent.</em></p><p><em><img class=\"fr-dib fr-draggable\" src=\"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/atg-storage-s3/assets/Frontend/images/article_image/feature_inside-104400000020182106205412.png\" data-error=\"0\" style=\"width: 322px; height: 230.141px;\"></em>&nbsp;</p>"

		"title" : "THREAT OF NEW ENTRANTS",
		"description" : "<p>A firm's profitability tends to be higher when other firms are blocked &nbsp;from entering the industry. New entrants can reduce industry profitability because they add new production capacity leading to increase supply of the product even at a lower price and can substantially erode existing firm's market share position. To discourage new entrants, existing firms can try to raise barriers to entry. Barriers to entry represent economic forces (or 'hurdles') that slow down or impede entry by other firms. Common barriers to entry include:</p><p><strong>Capital Requirements:</strong> When a large amount of capital is required to enter an industry, firms lacking funds are effectively barred from the industry, thus enhancing the profitability of existing firms in the industry. For example, huge investments are needed to build production facilities and establish brand awareness among people for entry into the pharmaceutical industry. This makes the entry of new companies into this sector very difficult.</p><p><strong>Economies of Scale:</strong> Many industries are characterized by economic activities driven by economies of scale refer to the decline in the per-unit cost of production as volume grows. A large firm that enjoys economies of scale can produce high volumes of goods at successively lower costs. This tends to discourage new entrants. For example, in the semiconductor industry, larger companies, such as IBM, Intel, Samsung and Texas Instruments, enjoy substantial economies of scale in the production of advanced microprocessors, communication chips and integrated circuits that power most consumer electronics, personal computers and cellular phones. This acts as a barrier for new entrants.</p><p><strong>Product Differentiation:</strong> Product differentiation refers to the physical or perceptual differences, or enhancements, that make a product special or unique in the eyes of customers. Firms in the personal care products and cosmetics industries actively engage in product differentiation to enhance their products features. Differentiation works to reinforce entry barriers because the cost of creating genuine product differences may be too high for the new entrants.</p><p><strong>Switching Costs:&nbsp;</strong>To succeed in an industry, new entrant must be able to persuade existing products. To make a switch, buyers may need to test a new firm's product, negotiate new purchase contracts, and train personnel to use the equipment, or modify facilities for product use. Buyers often incur substantial financial costs in switching between firms. When such switching costs are high, buyers are often reluctant to change. For example, high switching costs in moving away from Microsoft's Windows operating systems used in personal computers and corporate servers powered the company's stunning growth over the past decade in the software industry.</p><p><strong>Brand Identity:</strong> The brand identity of product or service offered by existing firms can serve as another entry barrier. Brand identity is particularly important for infrequently purchased products that carry a high unit cost to the buyer. New entrants often encounter significant difficulties in building up the brand identity, because to do so they must commit substantial resources over a long period. For example, during the 1970s, Japanese companies such as Toyota, Nissan, and Honda had to spend huge sums on new product development and promotional activities to overcome the American consumer's preference for domestic cars.</p><p><strong>Access to Distribution Channels: </strong>The unavailability of distribution channels for new entrants poses another significant entry barrier. Despite the growing power of the internet, many firms may continue to rely on their control of physical distribution channels to sustain a barrier to entry to rivals. Often, existing firms have significant influence over the distribution channels and can retard or impede their use by new firms. For example, because of control over distribution channels in India by HUL, P&amp;G and Godrej etc., small entrepreneur find it difficult to sell their products.</p>"

The country is known for its cultural heritage and unity in diversity. The sense of social responsibility was seeded in the minds of every child at home. Merchants and businessmen all across the Indian sub-continent have, through the ages, contributed to social causes as and when they can. People of the county with all its culture and tradition based on strong religious sentiments that promote generosity and sustainable growth of the society contribute well to all kinds of social upliftment and environmental betterment activities. The belief that what was taken from the society must be returned to the society itself, drives the countrymen to take up CSR activities and work towards achieving those goals with utmost dedication.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Gandhian philosophy of trusteeship was popular among the people after the independence struggle. A strong sense of togetherness brings up a habit of giving which was very much prevalent in the Indian society. Indians have not only contributed in education, environment and rural development. But forward thinkers of the pre-independence and post-independence era have supported and contributed to women empowerment and sanitary facilities throughout the county. This article will focus on the evolution and history of businessmen and their CSR activities in India.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The capability of companies in India to contribute to the society is high now and the government has realised it. Section 135 of the Companies Act, 2013 talks about the responsibility and the legal compulsion of corporate to spend money for CSR activities. The Schedule VII of the act talks about where and how this money can be spent. The view towards CSR as of now reflects in the amount money put in the Prime Minister’s Fund. Every company does not take the responsibility but simply, to comply by the act, transfers 2 percent allocated for the CSR activity to the Prime Minister's Fund.</p><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong> The recent legislations on CSR are most welcomed. But there should be proper regulations and ruled for its implementations by the corporate. Awards and incentives should be awarded for well performing companies in an attempt to increase such activities.</p><p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p><br></p>"

It has been stated that an ancient Indian ruler Muhammad Bin Tuqlaq once had this practice of demolishing <em>all the gold coins and changing it to copper coins</em>. The demonetisation policies of India came into existence on 8<sup>th</sup> November 2016. When the PM declared that the 500 and 1000 rupees notes were declared invalid. According to him “the banning of notes of higher values may make it difficult for the wrongdoers to store money in such a large notes.<a href=\"#_edn1\" name=\"_ednref1\" title=\"\">This as he said would bring into limelight about the black money holders.</a></p><p><a href=\"#_edn1\" name=\"_ednref1\" title=\"\">&nbsp;</a></p><p><a href=\"#_edn1\" name=\"_ednref1\" title=\"\">Generally from the survey conducted among bankers, businessmen and employed it is noted that all the three of them have more negative impacts than positive impacts. One thing very good about demonetization is that it had brought a fear and check on the corrupt people. But for bankers they feel that their work has been so tiring and hectic as they get pressure both from public as well as officials. Businessmen think that there should be have been a proper execution of the policy as they depend on public and banks for their business. On the other side, general public evidently suffer a lot of damage as they could not carry out their day to day transactions, standing in queues for money, blocking of card transaction, restriction on withdrawal of cash and so on. It can be concluded that sudden banning of a currency which is being in circulation of 86% of total circulation will have a negative impact on money supply which will in turn have its effect on liquidity and investment as both are depending upon flow of money.</a></p><a href=\"#_edn1\" name=\"_ednref1\" title=\"\"></a><a href=\"#_edn1\" name=\"_ednref1\" title=\"\"></a><a href=\"#_ednref1\" name=\"_edn1\" title=\"\"></a><a href=\"#_ednref1\" name=\"_edn1\" title=\"\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</a><a href=\"#_ednref1\" name=\"_edn1\" title=\"\">&nbsp;</a><a href=\"#_ednref1\" name=\"_edn1\" title=\"\">&nbsp;</a><p></p>"

These technological machines got involved in every area of our life; ranging from smartphones in our pockets all the way to the human robots. Whereas, machines have become an integral part of our daily lives. Robots are already replacing the labour force in some industries. At this point, many questions arise like, is the hypothesis of “robots bring unemployment in future” true? Will they change economy negatively or positively? Answering these questions, economists believe that, Robots not only decrease unemployment but also improves the economy of a country. Robots will replace the human being in the market, however, there still will be new jobs for human labour. &nbsp;</p><p>Technology never replaced a human being in the labour market. In fact, technology adds value to labour and increase efficiency. For instance, if now one accountant can do the job of 10 accountants with the help of a computer, one perspective is that technology killed those other 9 jobs. While on other perspectives, technology made this one accountant able to work 9 times more efficient.

He/she will buy more machines to expand their business which he/she will obviously need to hire more employees. Or the manufacturer will invest his profit in other businesses which will create employment for other entities. Or lastly, the manufacturer will spend the money to fulfil his daily needs which provide the job for small-scale businesses like tailor and baker and much more.

Carmakers respond to this demand with festive season discounts and freebies. This season saw over a dozen launches, which included completely new products as well as facelifts. Data from past years shows that festive season and wedding season contribute most to the sale of fresh cars as well as old and second-hand cars.</p><p>Many first-time buyers prefer to purchase cars that are pre-owned by somebody. It helps them in pre ensuring. People who do not know how to drive or are also first-time buyers do not prefer to buy new cars because people always fear to learn drive with their new cars. Often we see, people who are in their mid 30’s when bought cars for the first time, they too prefer to buy a second-hand car because of the age factor and also for learning driving from their first new cars can be a bit risky also. According to a report on India’s used car market released earlier this month by IndianBlueBook, a pricing guide for new and used cars, the pre-owned car market in India stands at 3.3 million units a year, which is 20% bigger than the new car market. More than half the times, a family’s first car comes from this market i.e second-hand market for cars. A study by Deloitte, Driving through the urban used-car market, says 73% pre-owned cars buyers are first –time car buyers.</p><p>Very obvious, buying the right used car can be more difficult than buying a new car. We take a look at some of the important aspects that buyers and sellers both should be mindful of:</p><p><strong>Why own a car that is a pre-owned?</strong></p><p>“A pre-owned car can be no from all aspects but the most basic and needful requirement can be satisfied with the second-hand car is that- feeling of ownership of a first car. We see India evolving similarly,” said Nagendra Palle, chief executive officer, Mahindra First Choice Wheel Ltd, a multi-brand platform to buy and sell used cars.</p><p>Though affordability can be the reason, it may not be the one. “many people prefer second-hand cars because these are value for money. You can sometimes or most of the times get a good vehicle at a relatively low price and that’s a far better option when you value the money.</p><p>&nbsp;President of CarDekho.com, Umang Kumar also a chief executive officer and co-founder of Gaadi.com, says buying pre-owned cars is a good and affordable option.</p><p>The second big advantage of owning a pre-owned car is that you can almost as a new car at fair prices i.e new car at the price of the second-hand car. Isn’t it a good deal? Earlier people used to drive cars for 10 to 12 years but now the trend has been changed and they have been dropped to around 5-6 years so many fo second-hand car is fairly new. This means you can buy’ as good as new’ car at the much lower price and use it for longer. But they want is that you need to research carefully before buying a new car and that can be a tedious job also.</p><p>If you are choosing the car of less popular brands, make sure maintenance services are easily available. And secondly, you must insist on getting a copy of the ownership papers in the new owner’s name.</p><p>The major aspect one can say in the industry of pre-owned car business are the discovery of the right product by the consumers, trust between a buyer and seller and pricing and financing. But with the emergence of online new schemes, the problem has been solved.<a href=\"%3Cp%3EIf%20you%20are%20choosing%20the%20car%20of%20less%20popular%20brands,%20make%20sure%20maintenance%20services%20are%20easily%20available.%20And%20secondly,%20you%20must%20insist%20on%20getting%20a%20copy%20of%20the%20ownership%20papers%20in%20the%20new%20owner%E2%80%99s%20name.%3C/p%3E%3Cp%3EThe%20major%20aspect%20one%20can%20say%20in%20the%20industry%20of%20pre-owned%20car%20business%20are%20the%20discovery%20of%20the%20right%20product%20by%20the%20consumers,%20trust%20between%20a%20buyer%20and%20seller%20and%20pricing%20and%20financing.%20But%20with%20the%20emergence%20of%20online%20new%20schemes,%20the%20problem%20has%20been%20solved.%20CarDekho.com%20or%20ZAP%20cars%20are%20the%20major%20boons%20in%20this%20industry.%3C/p%3E\" target=\"_blank\"></a></p><p><a href=\"%3Cp%3EIf%20you%20are%20choosing%20the%20car%20of%20less%20popular%20brands,%20make%20sure%20maintenance%20services%20are%20easily%20available.%20And%20secondly,%20you%20must%20insist%20on%20getting%20a%20copy%20of%20the%20ownership%20papers%20in%20the%20new%20owner%E2%80%99s%20name.%3C/p%3E%3Cp%3EThe%20major%20aspect%20one%20can%20say%20in%20the%20industry%20of%20pre-owned%20car%20business%20are%20the%20discovery%20of%20the%20right%20product%20by%20the%20consumers,%20trust%20between%20a%20buyer%20and%20seller%20and%20pricing%20and%20financing.%20But%20with%20the%20emergence%20of%20online%20new%20schemes,%20the%20problem%20has%20been%20solved.%20CarDekho.com%20or%20ZAP%20cars%20are%20the%20major%20boons%20in%20this%20industry.%3C/p%3E\" target=\"_blank\">If you are choosing the car of less popular brands, make sure maintenance services are easily available.

It is universally accepted that resources contribute to sustained competitive advantage only if they score well on the following questions:-</p><ul><li><strong>Is the resource durable? &nbsp;</strong><br>A resource that quickly becomes obsolete is unlikely to provide a sustainable advantage. The more durable the resource, the better.</li><li><strong>Is the resource mobile</strong><strong>?</strong>&nbsp;<br>Many resources are so easily moved between firms that they provide little sustainable benefit. For example people. The less mobile the resource, the better.</li><li><strong>Is the resource tradable</strong><strong>?&nbsp;</strong><br>Resources are particularly mobile if they can be bought and sold. The less tradable the resource, the better.</li><li><strong>Is the resource easily copied</strong><strong>?</strong> Many resources can be easily copied by competitors, leaving little scope for competitive advantage. Therefore, the less easily copied the resource, the better.</li><li><strong>Can the resource be substituted by something else</strong><strong>?</strong> Even if a resource cannot be bought or copied, an alternative serving a similar purpose can erode any advantage. The less easily substituted the resource, the better.</li><li><strong>Is the resource complementary with other resources</strong><strong>?&nbsp;</strong>Some resources work well to support one another. The more complementary the resource, the better.</li></ul><p><img class=\"fr-dib fr-draggable\" src=\"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/atg-storage-s3/assets/Frontend/images/article_image/feature_inside-11150000002018198877660.png\" data-error=\"0\" style=\"width: 446px; height: 446px;\"></p><p>We need to identify the resources, and then understand a crucial feature of how they behave. Also, costs are not driven only by having resources. It is also costly to win or develop resources. It is costly to start operations at a new firm too. Most importantly, making the whole system work requires people.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, A restaurant’s cooks and waiters, a carmaker’s production-line workers, and a law firm’s lawyers are all resources that enable the respective organizations to function. In certain cases, the production capacity itself may largely be made up of humans. The capacity of a law firm, for example, consists of the lawyers who do the work.</p><p>Talking about financial resources, cash itself is a resource which obeys the rules for resources.

This can be achieved by acquiring resources and building them but paying much less attention to keeping them. However, there is little advantage in trying to increase the stock of resources in the system in case the organization simply loses them again. Too often, customers are won, only to be lost again by poor products or service; staff are hired and trained, only to leave again for a host of reasons; new brands are established, only to become uncompetitive as the excitement of the launch fades; distribution agreements are set up, but stall when the company proves unable to sustain the relationship. Of course, there may be situations where the organization has a good reason to reduce resources deliberately. For example, cutting back on sales efforts as the firm progresses towards fully exploiting a market opportunity.</p><p>The development of a resource can be affected by inadequacies in other resources. The team should examine the strategic architecture, focusing on each resource and ascertaining whether its own growth may cause imbalances that restrict its further progress.</p><p><img class=\"fr-dib fr-draggable\" src=\"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/atg-storage-s3/assets/Frontend/images/article_image/feature_inside-11320000002018294228903.png\" data-error=\"0\" style=\"width: 350px; height: 408.511px;\"></p><p>In cases where resource limits and imbalances are serious, it may take too long to grow, develop, or reduce the necessary resources.

For instance, licensing products from other firms can quickly fill out a weak product range, and taking on contractors can rapidly relieve staff pressure.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Larger actions</strong> may be required to take the business to a whole new level, with a better balance and stronger growth potential. The acquisition is one of the clearest examples of such a shift for the whole organization. Also, rationalization of several parts of a system may be necessary to bring an ineffective organization back to the core of the activity that can be sustained into the future. This may entail rationalizing the product range, removing poor-quality customers, and cutting staff, all in a coherent move over a short period.</li></ul><p><br></p>"

One of the key observations is that using financial outcomes to guide decisions is likely to be hopeless. Clearly, the immediate consequences must make sense: You would not want to spend what you cannot afford or price your product so high which could kill current sales or so low as to destroy margin. But this does not count as a strategic control.</p><p>A simple principle guides how strategic decisions should be viewed i.e. Strategic management is 'all about flow rates'. The further you move away from this principle, the more likely it becomes that your decision rule will involve serious problems.</p><p><img class=\"fr-dib fr-draggable\" src=\"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/atg-storage-s3/assets/Frontend/images/article_image/feature_inside-113500000020182119556329.png\" style=\"width: 351px; height: 315.456px;\" data-error=\"0\"></p><p>The major question now is <strong>which performance metrics guide decisions best</strong>? Many organizations now use some form of balanced scorecard i.e. an integrated approach to measure performance. This indicates that financial factors alone provide inadequate targets and incentives and therefore adds measures relating to:-</p><ul><li><strong>customers</strong>: satisfaction, retention, market share, and share of business;</li><li><strong>internal performance</strong>: quality, response times, cost, and new product introductions;</li><li><strong>learning and growth</strong>: employee satisfaction and availability of information systems.</li></ul><p>If these additional factors are in good shape, the firm will be able to deliver a strong financial performance. The balanced scorecard offers important advances over traditional reporting approaches in recognizing the interconnection within the business and the importance of managing “soft” issues. Increasing training of staff about products, for example, will improve sales effectiveness, which in turn will lead to improved sales and margins.</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;Management techniques often fall from favor not because they are wrong, but because they are not used properly. Superficial work, done in the hope of a quick fix, is the common culprit. When senior managers instruct their people to undertake one initiative after another, none is carried to fruition before the next is begun. Initiative overload is one of the common causes of poorly implemented strategies.</p><p>Strategy dynamics is a powerful but demanding approach that needs to be done professionally and thoroughly. However, it is not typically more time-consuming or analysis-intensive than many other planning processes that organizations put themselves through. In fact, it often eliminates much activity, data processing, and analysis that would otherwise had to be carried out.</p>"

Public affairs and relations, personal selling and communicating are just ways to promote a brand image and build its name. A brand of any product is a unique identifier of the product through which it is known among its peers.</p><p><br></p><p>Like goodwill or any other assets of the business, branding is also a key element of providing the business with a long-term facility towards its goals. If there is a good brand in a product then they are certainly memorable, likely to be captivating in the eyes of the customers. A brand is not just a logo which defines the graphical image of a product.</p><p><br></p><p>With a strong brand structure, the whole health care system can benefit on a huge basis. Through a proper brand structure, multi-channel marketing can also be created with ease. Strong brands are likely to win due to its financial hold in the market.

The brand image will also provide you with top-notch physicians and attract a lot of patients. With slow and tactical steps, a modern brand image can be developed. Here are some of the few steps that can be followed to enable great strategic branding.</p><ul><li>Do your research well. To use a health care analogy, you must treat the causes and not the symptoms produced. Only after gathering enough qualitative as well as quantitative information, a strong brand strategy can be formed.</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li>Make consistency the prime element of your strategy. If you are making a brand structure then provide a good customer base so that your brand name is not dissolved easily. The ‘patient experience’ is a common term in the healthcare industry and there are many rooms to improve.</li></ul><p><br></p><ul><li>Try to communicate with the people by bringing your brand to life. Any absurd form of branding for a healthcare institution cannot be taken by the patients. Try to spread an important message for the brand you are building. The represent visually, communicate with the help of heat warming photographs and the aspects it has towards the brand.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Once you have all the ideas in, a strong brand image can be formed without any difficulty.

These opportunities are usually acquired from the commercial, economic and industrial fields of society. However in order to grab the opportunity from these field first and the foremost job of an entrepreneur is to transform his imagination and ideas of establishing a new business into enterprise. This transformation is a kind of process under which successive study and survey is conducted to transform the ideas into feasible opportunities. For an entrepreneur, it is possible only if the process is designed with a deliberate study.</p><p>Business opportunities are identified by entrepreneur through evaluation, examination and analysis.

Most resources, however, vary in important ways:</p><ul><li>Customers may be larger or smaller, highly profitable or not.</li><li>Products may appeal to many customers or a few, and satisfy some, many, or all of their needs.</li><li>Staff may have more experience or less, and cost high salaries or low.</li></ul><p>A <strong>resource attribute</strong> is a characteristic that varies between different items in a singular pool of resources. Attributes may be potential rather than actual and may still require efforts on our part if they are to be developed. For example, opening a new retail store brings access to the population around that store. Those potential customers will only become actual customers if the stores provide attractive products, prices, and service.</p><p><img class=\"fr-dib fr-draggable\" src=\"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/atg-storage-s3/assets/Frontend/images/article_image/feature_inside-114500000020181842649100.png\" data-error=\"0\" style=\"width: 376px; height: 376px;\"></p><p>However, it is important to focus on the correct attribute for the intended purpose. Customer revenue is a useful measure but may not necessarily correspond to customer profitability. One may need to think more widely for deciding which attributes are important, apart from revenue and profit contribution. For example, a majority of the banks is engaged in a competitive pursuit of individuals with high net worth. These customers have large potential deposits as well as borrowing needs on which a bank can make a good margin. They are, however, the best informed and least loyal of customers, often following the best deals from bank to bank. Far from being the most valuable customers, they can rather be the most costly to serve.</p><p>It is to be noted that it may be possible to do a profitable business serving customers that, for other companies, are unattractive. For example, the large information technology (IT) service providers such as Infosys, EDS, and CSC would not be interested in a moment in serving small business clients, but there is a prospective market for small computer support service providers among those same small clients.&nbsp;</p><p>If we are to add a clear picture of resource attributes to the strategic architecture, we need to capture their dynamics accurately. Three mechanisms cause attribute levels to change:-</p><ol><li><strong>Directly increasing the attribute</strong> without making any change to the tangible resource. For example, banks may win a larger share from existing customers by getting more of their savings/borrowing requirements.</li><li><strong>Obtaining new or better quality resources with more of the desired attribute</strong>. <br>This raises the average quality of the total resource pool. On the other hand, bringing in poorer quality resources disturbs the average quality.</li><li><strong>Losing the resources that have too little of the desired attribute</strong>. <br>This raises the average quality of those which remain. For example, dropping unprofitable customers or discontinuing unpopular products.</li></ol>"

		"title" : "Child’s Play- Managing Competitive Dynamics",
		"description" : "<p>Building our own resources is challenging enough, but competitors are not going to sit by and let you take whatever we want without a fight. Even in a nonbusiness situation, we struggle to win people, cash, supporters, and other resources.&nbsp;</p><p>A majority of the population think about <strong>rivalry&nbsp;</strong>in the context of competitive markets for goods and services. Discussions of competitiveness often focus on high-level measures such as sales growth, market share, etc. However, these are not factors which can have any direct effect but are the results of success in winning, developing, and retaining important resources.</p><p>Since most of what we know about rivalry comes from the knowledge of price- and value-based markets, it is perhaps not surprising that the customer markets grab all the attention. This focus has the most unfortunate consequence. The competitive strategy seems to have little relevance to nonprofit sectors such as public services, the voluntary sector, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). Yet these organizations constantly compete for resources. Skilled staff is an obvious example, but supporters, cash, and other resources must also be battled for.</p><p><img class=\"fr-dib fr-draggable\" src=\"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/atg-storage-s3/assets/Frontend/images/article_image/feature_inside-11480000002018161415731.png\" data-error=\"0\" style=\"width: 417px; height: 330.82px;\"></p><p>Nevertheless, customers are still the most obvious resource that must be won and retained against rivals, so this is where the focus is needed most. However, most of the principles are readily applicable to the rivalry for staff and other resources as well.</p><p>As new potential customers develop, rivals fight to win them to maximize profitability. They also seek to develop a potential pool of resources. The challenge for organizations, with developing potential customers, is to understand what is driving the customers’ choice. Their choices will be driven by the competitors’ decisions and actions, especially:-</p><ul><li>sales and marketing activities</li><li>relative prices</li><li>relatively perceived outcome of competing products.</li></ul><p>Many markets feature a group of hard-to-persuade customers who often fail to move despite strong inducements, either because of emotional reasons, such as loyalty or comfort or because of simple inertia. The deregulation of utility markets was supposed to encourage the mass migration of customers from inefficient incumbent suppliers to many new entrants who would offer competitive prices. In practice, many customers fail to switch in spite of the prospect of considerable savings.</p><p>This type of rivalry increases in importance as markets develop. Firms fight to pull customers out of their rivals’ resource systems and into their own, so the more customers are in that state, the more intense rivalry becomes. Customers benefit from a range of incentives to stay or join, which is why the regulatory competition policies focus strongly on eliminating switching costs.</p>"

		"title" : "Intangibles",
		"description" : "<p>Soft factors play a major role in competitive performance. A motivated staff is more productive than those with poor morale, a strong reputation in the market helps customer acquisition, a charity that enjoys its donors’ commitment will raise money more easily, and a political party with a stronger support among the electorate will get more votes. If we are to improve performance over time, then we have no other choice but to understand how to assess and influence those soft factors.</p><p>The performance at each moment depends on the tangible resources we can access. The only way to change the performance is by building and sustaining these resources. So, if soft factors are to make any difference to performance, they must do so by affecting our firm’s ability to capture and hold on to the same tangible resources.</p><p>Unfortunately, intangible resources can be tough to manage. We may easily borrow cash, buy production capacity, or hire staff, but it is slow and difficult to build a strong reputation, staff morale&nbsp;or support from our donors or voters.</p><p><img class=\"fr-dib fr-draggable\" src=\"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/atg-storage-s3/assets/Frontend/images/article_image/feature_inside-114200000020181350222058.png\" data-error=\"0\" style=\"width: 428px; height: 307.625px;\"></p><p>Once you have a strong intangible, it will automatically speed up the growth of other resources. Imagine the likely performance advantage for an organization with an edge in all these factors. Since it is often hard for competitors to see from outside what these intangibles exactly are and to work out how to collect them, they can give us as a sustainable advantage.</p><p>In a company, the atmosphere where people are confident and motivated feels quite different from that in an organization where staff is under pressure. Similarly, salespeople know the difference in a customer’s reaction when they try to sell products with a bad reputation, and CEOs notice the hostility of investors who have lost confidence in their management.</p><p>Organizations increasingly measure intangible factors like product and service quality, staff skills, and motivation. Even investor sentiment is periodically tracked and scrutinized by various companies. The achievements of exemplary managers in difficult situations make it clear that the intangibles are manageable. Effective factory managers can improve product quality, inspirational managers can boost the sales force morale and confidence, and a capable chief executive can reassure anxious investors.</p><p>A clue that we are dealing with an intangible resource comes when the word <strong>perceived</strong> features in our likely explanation for what is going on. Perceived menu quality is the key. For example, a restaurant’s ability to win new customers because those people do not have any direct experience of what they will be served until they have really eaten there. The perceived appeal of working in the media industry is key to encouraging young people to seek a job with the media (radio and TV) companies. The perceived quality of management is a vital factor for entrepreneurs to win over investors. This is barely a new idea, the core principle in cognitive psychology is that the <u>state of mind drives behavior</u>.</p><p><br></p>"

		"title" : "Business ethics and advertisement: How do these concepts interrelate?",
		"description" : "<p><span lang=\"EN\">In order to understand the relationship between business ethics and advertising, we need to&nbsp;</span>give a deep insight into<span lang=\"EN\">&nbsp;the role of advertising in the context of broader business operations. This is appropriate because business ethics is expressed and&nbsp;</span>is <span lang=\"EN\">evolved in the context of any business activity. Advertising is the most important </span>part<span lang=\"EN\">&nbsp;of these functions in terms of compan</span>ies’<span lang=\"EN\">&nbsp;communication with the wider audience.</span></p><p>When creating a new company or expanding it by launching a new service or product, a business plan should implement that deals with the procedures that should be followed. A key element of this plan is the marketing mix that is dictated by the marketing strategy that has been shaped by market research, segmentation and targeting to potential consumers. The marketing strategy to be described as successful must serves the marketing ideology apart from being technically perfect.</p><p><span lang=\"EN\">The marketing ideology</span>,<span lang=\"EN\">&nbsp;in turn</span>,<span lang=\"EN\">&nbsp;is summarized in the following principles:&nbsp;</span></p><p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span lang=\"EN\">It is based on intense,continuous and unrestricted business orientation towards the buyer</span></p><p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It r<span lang=\"EN\">ecognizes that the buyer is the only one who knows what to satisfy</span></p><p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It r<span lang=\"EN\">ecalls that the sole purpose of each business is to meet the buyer's needs,from which&nbsp;</span>the company will generate <span lang=\"EN\">profit</span>s<span lang=\"EN\">. This satisfaction will be achieved by accurately delivering&nbsp;</span>the<span lang=\"EN\">product specification requirements.This ideology must serve without provoking and offending the common sense of ethics that governs the average consumer</span></p><p>The marketing mix consists of four elements, one of which is the promotion. Advertising is the mean by which the enterprise is addressed to the wider community regardless of whether it is made up of potential buyers or not. Therefore, advertising is the way in which business ethics, as embodied in all of the company's operations, is expressed and communicated to the public</p><p>At this point, it raises <span lang=\"EN\">two key questions: First, to what extent advertising reflects the business ethics</span>? Is it able <span lang=\"EN\">to&nbsp;</span>make<span lang=\"EN\">&nbsp;consumers&nbsp;</span>understand<span lang=\"EN\">&nbsp;how the business operates in the whole range of its activities, eg, labor relations, economic policy,&nbsp;</span>and <span lang=\"EN\">administrative decisions</span>?<span lang=\"EN\">&nbsp;Secondly,&nbsp;</span>can<span lang=\"EN\">&nbsp;the image of the business, from an ethical point of view be altered to presentan idealized advertising</span>?</p><p>To answer the first question, we can say that the advertising campaigns clearly cannot give a complete picture of the companies’ ethics. Butthere are aspects of the business that can be seen in advertising. In principle, consumers can see whether the business respects them or not. For example, if the advertising message is particularly challenging or if it tries to \"rape\" its value system by identifying products with socialrecognition, it is an indication that the business does not follow some moral limits.</p><p><span lang=\"EN\">Also,&nbsp;</span>in some cases, <span lang=\"EN\">consumer</span>s viewing an advertisement<span lang=\"EN\">&nbsp;may</span><span lang=\"EN\">&nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN\">understand the way</span> that<span lang=\"EN\">&nbsp;business</span>es&nbsp;deal<span lang=\"EN\">&nbsp;with various issues</span>, <span lang=\"EN\">such as environment,&nbsp;</span>minority<span lang=\"EN\">&nbsp;groups,&nbsp;</span>and <span lang=\"EN\">global unemployment.&nbsp;</span>Concerning<span lang=\"EN\">&nbsp;the second the issue</span>, namely<span lang=\"EN\">&nbsp;the deterioration of the actual code of ethicsthat exists,&nbsp;</span>so that<span lang=\"EN\">&nbsp;consumers have a good image of the business, we can accept that it ispartly true.</span><span lang=\"EN\">&nbsp;</span>Empirically evidence shows that after a while,the majority of consumers understand the fraud on the part of the business and turns as boomerang damaging its brand image</p><p><span lang=\"EN\">Consumer</span>s’<span lang=\"EN\">&nbsp;maturity, increased critical capacity, level of education, level of information, and willingness to deal with relevant issues,play a particularly important role in&nbsp;</span>the&nbsp;ethics of advertising<span lang=\"EN\">. At present, consumers have, on average, satisfactory levels of literacy, judgment</span>,<span lang=\"EN\">&nbsp;and maturity. This translates into the fact that businesses need to be very careful and not try to&nbsp;</span>deceive <span lang=\"EN\">consumers about their ethics by using advertising</span> So, nowadays, <span lang=\"EN\">consumers have the opportunity to see the true motives behind&nbsp;</span>companies’ <span lang=\"EN\">advertising</span> and hence <span lang=\"EN\">businesses are forced to revise their own incentives to&nbsp;</span>be<span lang=\"EN\">&nbsp;moral&nbsp;</span>if firms want to maintain their <span lang=\"EN\">competitive advantage</span>s!</p>"

They are the factors which determine how well groups achieve tasks that are critical. For our strategic architecture of resources, one of the most critical tasks is building and retaining resources. Capabilities differ from resources in the following way:-</p><ul><li>Resources are useful items that we own or can access.</li><li>Capabilities are activities that our organization is good at performing.</li></ul><p>Capabilities are important because they determine how effectively our organization builds, develops, and retains resources. A more capable organization will be able to build resources faster and hold resource losses at a slower rate than a less capable organization. Capabilities, like intangible resources, are ambiguous items that are difficult to measure and manage. Nevertheless, they are important drivers of performance over a period of time, so attempts must be made to understand and manage them.</p><p><img class=\"fr-dib fr-draggable\" src=\"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/atg-storage-s3/assets/Frontend/images/article_image/feature_inside-114400000020181723988633.png\" data-error=\"0\" style=\"width: 377px; height: 282.561px;\"></p><p>A team’s capability is the ratio between the rate at which it actually achieves tasks and the best rate that we can imagine. Never confuse team capabilities with individual skills.&nbsp;</p><p>Clever organizations manage to hire relatively unskilled people and generate outstanding performance. Consulting firms take newly trained professionals and enable them to deliver sophisticated business solutions. Fast-food firms take unskilled staff and produce highly consistent products, call centers take people with little understanding of the organization’s products and clients and manage&nbsp;to produce excellent customer support; and so on.</p><p>Clearly, these organizations achieve much of this performance by training people. In other words, by adding to individual skills. But they also<strong>&nbsp;develop, test, and operate proven procedures</strong>. Team capability reflects the combination of individual skills and these effective procedures.</p><p>Such procedures add up to a library of instructions for completing specific activities reliably and quickly. This library is an effective resource and like any resource, it is built up over time. It is also kept up to date by the removal of obsolete procedures and the addition of new ones.&nbsp;</p><p><img class=\"fr-dib fr-draggable\" src=\"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/atg-storage-s3/assets/Frontend/images/article_image/feature_inside-111100000020181131314362.png\" data-error=\"0\" style=\"width: 494px; height: 263.077px;\"></p><p>Team capabilities are built up by being utilized, much as individual skills are. Procedures for getting things done are available to be recorded whenever they take place. Clearly the more chances the team has to practice its developing and retention of resources, the more opportunities arise to improve and record the procedures that work best.&nbsp;</p><p>The bottom line is that the rate of resource flow determines the rate at which capabilities can be improved. There are some cases where capability does not directly relate to a specific resource flow, but they tend to be less influential on long-term strategic performance than are these tightly coupled pairing of resource and capability.</p>"

It's not about business but everywhere. Business owner gradually develops an intuition or call it a sixth sense which is hugely valuable for helping to make better decisions about everything we do in business.</p><p>But the problems arise when we become too busy in hearing what our intuition says or trying to say. We intellectualize because we are so bombarded with the information that e simply can't hear our intuition in midst of the clutter. But we can learn to see and hear our intuition to make a great change in our&nbsp;love when we make a deal.</p><p><strong>1. Try to reconnect how you feel</strong></p><p>Always look for the reality of a situation. There are many times your instinct will tell you not to do this in business but the brain will rationalize it in some different way and will give you something different. We just need to reconnect with how we feel at a deeper level with a free mind.</p><p><strong>2. Learn from the right things in the past</strong></p><p>Think about all the things you have done in the past and the think about all the right things you have done in the past. Feel good about those things and then get yourself some motivation. Try to reconnect with how you intuitively felt as they developing. That's the intuitive feeling we want to look for to give us the green light.</p><p><strong>3. Have a checklist for all the decisions</strong></p><p>Always have a checklist to help decide what things to do in a specific project. It will contain things like things which will interest you, is it profitable enough, do you have a skill etc. This will really help but most important to add to the checklist is \"what my intuition says?\". This has changed everything and makes difference. So take a project which shows actually blue ticks on your intuition message.</p><p>Intuition is not a new thing. We all know about it, we all have it but we don't use it. Intuition, sixth sense, instinct or call whatever you want to call but the more we listen to it, easier it becomes for us to have better decisions in our life. And, hence the quality of our decision will be reflected.</p>"

It requires knowledge, business planning, and vision.<br><br></p><p>In which questions a business plan should answer?</p><p>· Where is your business now?</p><p>· Which would you like to see your business in the future?</p><p>· How do you plan to get there?</p><p>These are the three basic questions where a business plan calls for answers whether you have a kind of business or are planning to open a company in the future.<br>In any case, the business plan should be a clear and comprehensible presentation of the goals and activities that the business is about to develop.</p><p>Also, some useful questions you can ask yourself are:</p><p>· Why do you think your business idea will be sustainable?</p><p>· What products and services do you sell?</p><p>· Why should you choose a consumer rather than your competitors?</p><p>· What else can you offer?</p><p>· What market needs do you plan to cover?</p><p>It should be noted that many businessmen do not have clear answers to these questions and this can prevent the company from developing and profiting.</p><p>&nbsp;Drawing your business plan, you can make a description of your products by placing a special emphasis on how to use their customers.</p><p>What will be the benefit for the consumers if they purchase your product?</p><p>Also, it is imperative to show the reasons why your product will be successful on the market and continue with an analysis of the market you plan to operate by specifying the customers you address, and the profile of the consumer you are interested in making your customer, their habits, and income. What’s more, being aware of the competition that you may encounter is also very important for placing your business on the market. After doing an analysis of your products and services, customers and competitors, you can then describe who you would like to see your business after a few years, namely which is the vision that you have for the future and the personal lifestyle that you would like to live with. Finally, you should develop a strategy and set individual goals.</p><p>In the end, determine how you will reach the desired point in the future.<br>In this part, you should analyze the viability of the business according to the activities it is going to be developed.<br>All possible costs and revenues of the company should be calculated to allow proper planning for the achievement of the company's objectives. <span lang=\"EN\">Cost calculations are made after you have taken into account the cost of setting up your business, the cost of purchasing equipment, operating expenses, staff salary costs, and working capital needed to start the business.<br>The company’s revenues need a careful estimation and are calculated on the basis of sales forecasts.<br>Sales forecasts are based on the calculation of the competitive advantages of your products, the size of the market you targets, the current competition and sales of past years, if your business is already operating, or sales of similar businesses if you are starting now.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN\">I hope all the above steps not to seem to you as a \"mountain\". It's not something that should scare you.<br>It takes determination and self-discipline to complete it.<br>Think that the business plan you make will be the \"bushel\" in your business and does not need to be static.<br>If you want to change something you have all the freedom to do it!</span></p>"

We also remember&nbsp;the days when we know 2 or 3 restaurants&nbsp;that deliver food home so as to skip a day's cooking. But now it's all changed.</p><p>We book a cab, in minutes, it arrives and we go home. A million options to choose from while we sit at our desk ordering food. How does this all happen? Goods and services delivered through an app have made the world, even more, smaller, faster and lazier.&nbsp;</p><p>These apps are widespread in all sectors. Allow me to give you examples.</p><p>Food sector - Swiggy, Zomato</p><p>Cabs &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Ola, Uber</p><p>E-commerce- Flipkart, Amazon</p><p>Services &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Practo, Tuner automobiles.</p><p>So how do these apps enjoy profits?</p><p>In the case of Swiggy, the app has provided a platform for restaurants and customers to order and deliver food. A certain amount of commission is given to the app for food ordered through the app i.e The app lets people know that such and such restaurant delivers food, a person orders through the app, so new customers are created for the restaurant and this service is turned into profit. Swiggy also gets paid for delivering food for restaurants that do not have a delivering facility.</p><p>In the case of Tuner automobiles, the app offers various car and bike services on the app. One can simply order for a car wash, select the nearest service station and get it done on spot. The platform provided is \"encashed\".</p><p>Several of these startups are now business giants but companies like Uber and food panda, with a lot of investment, are serious competition nevertheless.</p>"

		"description" : "<p>The problem of data explosion is inherent to the complexity of the modern business market. This is because the development of the IT sector and especially the advent of Internet provoke a proliferation to the data and consequently to the information that companies receive. Particularly, companies understanding the great value that data put in the organizations’ development were prompted to collect and produce lots of data so as to ensure that they are fully aware oftheir operating activities and the market trends.&nbsp;</p><p>Due to these practices, the data explosion appears. As data explosion can be defined as the phenomenon of which the sheer amount and the volume of data are becoming unmanageable for companies. The prime risk that entails the constant growth of data is that data become less structured; hence making difficult for executives to extract the proper information and acquire a full picture of whatt he whole data depict.&nbsp;</p><p>So,the data explosion triggers concerns regarding how to handle all the data amassed, while there is a heated debated regarding the amount of data that companies should produce, and collect since lots of them are not exploited and become outdated due to their limited lifespan. Respectively, companies devote lots of money to hold data that may not be useful for its operating activities if they are not exploited in a certain time. Therefore, data explosion may harm the data quality as the managers’ decisions will be based on data that are not accurate and timely anymore. So, while the problem in the previous decades was how to collect data, in our modern economy the problem documents on how to effectively utilize the data received since the warehouse of data does not ensure the good management of them but it can be said that it is only a good start. &nbsp;</p><p>Due to these hurdles, many researchers suggest that some useful ways to deal with such unfavorable situation are to structure a plan in which the data will be arranged properly, to implement real-time processing for interpreting data and to analyze unstructured content. &nbsp;To do this, Information Technology and Information Management can play a pivotal role in enhancing the data revenues strategy and the business attempt to ameliorate the data quality since optimizing companies’ software and hardware programs,companies will be able to apply more efficient data mining techniques, extracting timely and relevant data and categorizing them. All these benefits lead to better interpreting data that are useful for the organizations’ operation and relatively to the decision-making process. Also, this method helps companies to prevent from confronting with the problem of outdating data given that the collection and the standardization of the data would become in as hort amount of time. As a matter of fact, modern companies should be able to allocate a great number of their budgets in the IT technologies and in hiring people that expertise in this scientific field.&nbsp;</p><p>Once again…. Do not forget that data explosion can be a huge problem in companies’ efficacy and measures should be taken in order to resolve this problem. Take the advantage of Information Technology and see how quick your profits will be increased!</p>"

If a culture is overly relaxed, the company can face problems attracting and retaining conservative professionals who may consider the workplace to be inadequately serious and detrimental in the long run for their careers. If the culture is too formal and strict, young and creative employees are likely to feel awkward and out of their water. If women and minorities are not welcome, charismatic individuals belonging to these groups will seek work elsewhere. None of these groups will be willing to work for a company when its culture is dominated by conflicts, persecution, non-functioning top management, or over-privileged hierarchy.</p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">As a first step, to improve the company’s culture, ask your employees the following questions:</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">1.

Here are some indicative scenarios:</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN\">1st: The young employees in your department want a much simpler, more enjoyable and dynamic culture. They think that this culture is too formal and rigid.

		"description" : "<p>The quality management strategy is a relatively recent phenomenon which is the result of the constant search for a stable competitive advantage in the context of growing market competition. The strategic approach to quality, due to its preventative nature, is considered the most appropriate for the diversification of the services offered, as opposed to the occasional effort to improve the quality that is expressed in response to market needs and therefore is passive.</p><p>Critical variables for the success of quality management have identified the time, organizational transformation towards aculture of quality with modern technology. The intensity of quality management activities is considered to affect not only the quality but also the ability ofthe business to respond to the customer's needs in a flexible way.</p><p>Quality management, as a universal approach, is based on specific fundamental principles:</p><p>• A client orientation that includes both the outside and the interior, as a common goal of the efforts of the whole organization and its members</p><p>• Process orientation that enables them to be analyzed in key tasks, as part of the quality chain with specific customers and</p><p>• The continuous improvement of products andservices through the use of people in identifying and implementing the appropriate changes.</p><p>To improve service quality, companies should:</p><p>• Focus on the market and the customers that allow the diagnosis of their needs and expectations and the manifestation ofsuch actions</p><p>• Independent responsibility of first-lineworkers that gives them the power to make important customer service decisions</p><p>• The existence of properly trained staffwith development opportunities and reward systems and recognition and performance evaluation; and</p><p>• The existence of a clear service qualityvision that precludes the arbitrary interpretation of quality service and the inconsistency of its efforts to improve and the variability of the results</p><p>Of course, a strong competitive strategy cannot be realized without the existence of stable and competent human resources, as the high dynamism of the markets has made it an important source of competitive advantage.</p><p>The human resources capabilities and theircontinuous upgrading and enrichment are a strategic determinant of quality andhigh economic outcomes. The more skilled and knowledgeable the human potentialis, the more appropriate it is to design processes and offer services that bestmeet customer needs.</p><p>Proper encouragement and the provision ofdevelopment perspectives are favorable conditions in this direction. The needto continually improve quality and increase productivity often leads companiesalong with their dramatic cost cuts, to reductions in their human resources,which entails additional staffing difficulties for the remaining staff. Qualitymanagement requires a flexible, competent and high commitment to the commonhuman resources objectives.</p><p>Finally, technology is referred to as a means oflimiting the complexity of service processes, expanding the possibilities ofoffering services of many different choices, with significant economies ofscale. The use of technology, in addition to the partial substitution of humanlabor (as in the case of ATMs), gives new dimensions to the skills and skillsof workers. It is believed to upgrade their knowledge and enhance thedevelopment of their skills in the services they provide and in customerservice</p>"

		"description" : "<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>The dark side of startup failure</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;Every person in this world have some problems and issues. Some felt it a lot and without facing they just dump their life and some take it in an easy way and face it and they don&#39;t even think whether the results will be positive or negative. Some people are depressed from their families, some from their jobs and several other reasons can be listed and such lists can&#39;t be end. Now question arises what&#39;s the difference between these two types of people. Firstly, the people who are not able to console themselves, feel demotivated all the time, they just start going into the depression and hence they are not affected by their surroundings of what is happening nearby. They just started to be in themselves and hence they may choose the wrong path like drinking alcohols every time and all the day or they start taking drugs like cocaine or the drug injections. As a result, they become addicted to all this and once the availability of all these things gets disrupted, they began to lose their control over their mind and actions and start doing criminal offences for such things or either they can suicide or sometimes time itself ruins their life and such kind of people have no future rather than black life and at end they rest in peace However sometimes it&#39;s not the fault of that particular person. Sometimes the society is equally responsible for such instances. In this era, with increasing competition levels, the achievement of success rate requires a lot of hardwork and a lot of hardships. Some people have financial problems and they either take the loans or they just do part time jobs for their dreams to be fulfilled. Ass a result, the loan taking persons fall in debt and started staying in depression. As a result, the people started abusing them and all their confidence level gets loosen and they lost their goals. However government should also help such kind of people so that everyone can achieve their goals and also everyone has the right to life happy and healthy life. On the other hand, the people though belonging to the middle and poor family, being full determined and confident about their goals in future face hardships and it is the person itself only who can give strength and motivation to themselves and achieve their goal. They never listen to what other people say about them and this is the most positive thing which every person should have in his heart and nind. Person should always kept in his mind &ldquo;Winners never quit and quitters never win.&rdquo;</p>\r\n"

		"title" : "Finding the Perfect Dropshipping Supplier",
		"description" : "<p>The whole dropshipping model will be based with the suppliers doing their job really well and are fulfilling orders efficiently and punctually. Therefore, it goes well without saying that selecting the right suppliers are the most important initial step towards opening a successful brand. When it happens that the supplier messes up your order, your business and you are the one responsible for it, so the key is to look for someone that will stick with the plan and have an open communication when there are issues that will arise in the future of team-up.</p><p><img class=\"fr-dib fr-draggable\" src=\"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/atg-storage-s3/assets/Frontend/images/article_image/feature_inside-01300000002019173841632.png\" data-error=\"0\"></p><p>Below are some of the factors to bear in mind when selecting the dropshipping supplier:</p><p>1. Look for the experienced dropshipper with helpful sales agents. Nothing beats experiences. A dropshipper who is aware of the pitfalls of dropshipping and about how you can handle them effectively, coupled with the sales representative that will answer any queries will surely put your mind and worries at ease, and it will make a really good team-up and will definitely reflect a positive impression on your business.</p><p>2. Look for a dropshipper that will provide high quality, top-notch products. The high quality products give way to a high level of consumer satisfaction and that means a lower cost of unsatisfied customers and returned items. Testimonials and product reviews will go a very long way in boosting business, thus, having the best quality products are imperative.</p><p>3. Look for a dropshipper that has technological capabilities. When choosing your dropshipper, be sure that they know some technological abilities in keeping up with the time. When you want to scale up your business, it might be a disgrace if you have to break the great business alliance with your dropshipper just so they would not be able to maintain with your growth.</p><p>4. Look for the dropshipper who is efficient and punctual with the dropshipping process. Dropshippers that are shipping products within 24-48 hour period is the great way to make sure that the customers are being satisfied and happy. Because of the market’s competitiveness, long shipping times may be unattractive to your customers. This can be advisable to put on your test orders with the suppliers to see how they process their work and to have the best idea before you come up with the final decision of choosing them as your suppliers.</p><p>This may sound really simple, but, Google will be a best bet when searching for your future dropship suppliers. Some of the websites and startup incubators dedicated to Ecommerce, which pop up as hunt results, will have the entire directories of Dropshippers with the contact details. The moment you have acquired the contact details for the dropshipping supplier that are providing products you have an interest in selling, then, send them some polite, short email asking a few of your relevant questions. By this way, you will be able to gauge about how rapidly they respond and about how helpful the sales representatives are.</p><p>It is not always likely to know whether your suppliers and you will be of perfect fit right off a bat, but, it is likely to ask some questions that can make the vetting procedures more efficient.</p><p><span class=\"fr-video fr-dvb fr-draggable\" contenteditable=\"false\" draggable=\"true\"><iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wBlYHIxHlM4\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></span></p><p><a href=\"https://www.famousbirthdays.com/people/josh-madrid.html\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><small>Josh King Madrid</small></a><small>&nbsp;better known as Jet, is a successful serial entrepreneur, investor, marketing specialist, coach and CEO of Team Jet Set, he specializes in the industries of e-commerce, marketing, business consulting, and fitness.</small></p>"

		"description" : "<p>The balance between work and personal life is a big issue nowadays. Many people say enough with endless days of work, torn vacations, and nights spent in hotel rooms, and emails that take weekends from their boss. A lot of companies have received the message and responded properly by launching programs that help employees to balance the two sides of their lives.&nbsp;</p><p><span lang=\"EN\">Many entrepreneurs consider that any concession made for the purpose of reconciling work and personal life would correspond to significant costs for the companies and a burden to their finances. However, the balance between work and personal life can be modeled through a \"win-win\" perspective and not through a game with any effects.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN\">Work and personal life are not competitive but complementary priorities. In essence, they have adopted a philosophy that everyone wins. And they appear to be right. The new approach does not bring tangible benefits to both companies and employees individually.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN\">So, if companies want to maintain a good state in their businesses without exhausting their employees but rather keep them happy and pleased, they should read the following advice.&nbsp;</span></p><p>1. Ensure that employees understand the company's priorities and encourage them to be clear about their personal priorities: The company’s job must be done and the balance between work and personal life must not be an excuse to slip away. Alternatively, work cannot be an excuse to leave important personal slogans to slide. Directors need to be clear about the company's goals and performance. At the same time, they should encourage employees to be clear about their goals as members of a family and as individuals.&nbsp;</p><p>Once all these are done, programs and tasks can usually be customized in ways that meet both sides. The fact that these directors define business success based on the results is definitely essential. For them, the results count more than the process. On this basis, they provide their employees with specific goals but also great autonomy in how to achieve these goals. The combination ofemployees’ autonomy along with the determination of the goals and the expected results is a procedure that helps to be promoted a more flexible schedule for employees’ working hours.&nbsp;</p><p>2. Recognize and support employees as integrated personalities who have important roles outside the workplace: Directors can only handle the conflict of work and personal life if they understand and are interested in the extra-life lives of their employees. The sign of real interest creates a bond and gradually a sense of trust which brings to the company benefits that each manager anticipates.</p><p>3. Continually experiment with how employees perform the job: Smart managers know that production processes need to be revised and redesigned periodically for greater efficiency and effectiveness. The balance between work and personal life contains opportunities to experiment with these processes. In the descriptions of directors who have successfully implemented the work-life balance, conflicts between work and personal life priorities can indeed be catalysts for identifying work-related disadvantages that otherwise would be hidden.</p><p>These three principles should function as a guideline of each company in order to introduce programs that rejuvenate employees, relax them when needed and make them more productive to their job as they are able to strike a balance between the job and their personal obligations!</p>"

		"description" : "<p>The purpose of communication is to effect change, to influence action towards the welfare of the enterprise. Communication is essential because, it integrates the managerial function. Every aspect of manager’s job may it be planning, organizing, staffing, directing and controlling involves communication. Business persons share their business information with employees, suppliers, customers, distributors, Government, banks, insurance companies, etc. This sharing of information regarding business activities and their results is known as business communication. Business communication plays a very important role in the success of any business enterprise. The importance of communication in business is discussed below</p><p><strong>1. Provide Information:</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Business communication helps in providing information to the customers regarding the products and services of the business organization.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>2. Quick Decision Making:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;Effective communication facilitates quick-decision making. In today’s world of competition, quick-decisions are necessary. Proper Communication saves times, reduces wastage and cost and induces prompt action.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3. Effectively Managing Business Affairs: &nbsp;</strong></p><p>Proper communication helps businesspersons in managing the affairs of the business more efficiently. If the right type of information is made available at the right time through proper communication then the management can utilize it in the best possible manner.</p><p><strong>4. Handling Grievances:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;In any organization where communication is proper, employees are motivated to work more because their complaints, suggestions and grievances are taken care of properly.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>5. Improved Offerings of Business:</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>In every field, technology is continuously changing. Proper communication places a business person in a better position to improve his products, relationship with employers, customers and others.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>6. Achieving Objectives and Implementing Policies:</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Management of an organization is effective only when its communication machinery is effective. The very existence of management depends upon an effective machinery of communication. Effective communication machinery is important because it communicates, and helps in implementing, the policies and objectives of the organization on the one hand, and also helps in understanding the nature and behavior of the people at work.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>7. Correct Interpretation of Messages:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A message can be interpreted by the recipient according to the image of the communicator in the mind of the recipient. If the image is bad, the version of the message may be distorted and interpreted differently. The bad image can be erased through proper communication from the other side, which is possible only when there is two-way communication in the organization.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;8. Morale of Organizational Members:</strong> Thus, creation of organizational systems allowing two-way traffic will improve the morale of the workers on the one hand because they think that they have a say in the management, and will improve the working of the organization on the other hand, because management-worker relations develop in a cordial atmosphere. Thus, two-way communication is necessary for effective management.</p><p><br></p>"

For this reason, quantitative and qualitative media planning should be organized. An appropriate allocation method is to combine both traditional and digital media so as to balance the benefits and the risk of the company’s strategy by developing good communication with the targeted customers.&nbsp;</p><p>The main goal of such an investment is to raise awareness about the product/service benefits, highlights the brand, create a professional image of the company, and inform the customers about the products so as to increase sales.

Besides, through the available online platforms, in which customers can interact with each other and communicate with representatives of the company, the company may achieve a better interface with its customers, as the latter understand that the company try to meet their demands and want to satisfy their needs eventually leading to building strong bonds of trust with the brand. &nbsp;Moreover, people exchange experiences about the brand, companies start to have funs, followers and thus its reputation is expanded a lot globally.&nbsp;</p><p>Aligned with this, traditional media can have a counter balancing function and companies should invest less money in it so as to be achieved brand visibility for those that are not involved in the digital market.&nbsp;</p><p>Therefore, it is suggested that it should be allocated from $400 to $10,000 to branding, $3,500 to $15,000 in websites, $1,500-$4,000 to social media, $300 per month to $3,000 in ad content, and $250 to $1,000 to events and $500 to $800 in traditional media. In general terms, new companies could allocate 12 to 20 percent of its gross revenue on marketing, while established companies between 6 and 12 percent of their gross revenue. Another interesting approach is to create a &nbsp;“safe” budget which includes 70% of the budget be allocated to “tried and true” channels, 20% allocated to “safe bets”, and 10% allocated to “experimental”. Undoubtedly, all these values should be examined according to the objectives of the company and the prime areas that they want to focus more</p>"

Shareholders, employees and other stakeholder groups, such as suppliers and the local community in which the business is active, want and deserve to enjoy a moral response and attitude.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the need for ethical leadership may become more apparent than the analysis of the impact of a company when it is absent. Some of the consequences are as follows:</p><p><span lang=\"EL\">1.&nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">The collapse of corporate culture&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">If leader</span>s<span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;do not&nbsp;</span>behave in an ethical manner<span lang=\"EN-US\">,&nbsp;</span>t<span lang=\"EN-US\">he</span>y<span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;lose&nbsp;</span>their<span lang=\"EN-US\">credibility</span> and reputation to the business world. Also, given that <span lang=\"EN-US\">an efficient business is based&nbsp;</span>on <span lang=\"EN-US\">credibility</span>and<span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;equity,&nbsp;</span>leaders cannot successfully fulfill their roles. As a result of this phenomenon, more and more employees<span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;plunge into unethical behavior to the point where practices will become norms.&nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EL\">Therefore</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">, the entire corporate culture will collapse.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">2. The reduction in the value of the shareholders</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Many companies saw the value of their shares collapse as a result of moral problems and their consequences. The role of so-called \"golden boys\" in precipitating the value of well-known multinational companies and in shaping the gloomy financial crisis is a recent</span>trend<span lang=\"EN-US\">. If leader</span>s&nbsp;are<span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;not governed by moral values it is easier to adopt dubious economic and business practices.&nbsp;</span>However, t<span lang=\"EN-US\">he consequences of disclosing these practices, especially for companies listed on the stock exchange have proved to be disastrous</span> forbusinesses’ sustainability and thus for shareholders’ interest.&nbsp;</p><p><span lang=\"EL\">3. </span>The defamation&nbsp;</p><p>The business irresponsibility demonstrated by well-known companies worldwide over the last decades has brought them to court trips and has caused them considerable defamation and harm. It takes twenty years to build the company's reputation and five minutes to be destroyed. As a consequence of this, today, there is a growing tendency for leaders to look beyond the close interest of shareholders, employees, and suppliers. Keep in mind that the general public is a part of a socially responsible behavior of the company which tends to occupy a higher priority in matters of management agenda.</p><p>4. <span lang=\"EN\">The inability to attract talented workers</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN\">When it becomes known&nbsp;</span>to the public<span lang=\"EN\">&nbsp;that a company resorts to unethical practices&nbsp;</span>employees usually are afraid of applying for a job position in these Companies because of their bad reputation to the market.

And that's the type of workforce that high-ranking executives face in many parts of the world. From age and gender, to part-time and full-time status, ethnicity, race, sexual orientation and physical ability companies benefit from the differences between employees. Uniform strategies for maintaining good staff simply do not work anymore. Companies can improve employee retention rates by formulating creative and specialized strategies for every major part of the workforce.</p><p>The members of the temporary workforce, part-time workers, project promoters and temporary workers provide some important advantages, as well as challenging managerial and human resource departments.</p><p>The main advantages include:</p><p>· Exhibition, as companies can personalize the timetables of these employees to deal with their current workflow and demand by using them only when they are charged.</p><p>· Economic capability as businesses employing temporary agents, part-time workers, or freelancers spends money on payroll taxes, health insurance, and other costs.</p><p>Challenges include:<br><br></p><p>· A high degree of renewal that introduces unpredictability and instability into the enterprise culture</p><p>· High degree of commitment to the business and its products</p><p>· Increasing demand for the same benefits that regular employees enjoy, such as job satisfaction and career development support.</p><p>Because the extraordinary workforce is a valuable resource, many companies are currently developing programs specifically designed to maintain these employees.</p><p>Also, the younger workers, especially those aged 20 to 30, bring energy, vitality and advanced technology knowledge to the workforce of a business. Young workers are particularly keen to chart their career paths and take up a job that will help them advance to their next jobs.</p><p>Nonetheless, many new and young employees are very comfortable with quick changes and flat management structures from their older colleagues. This may create misunderstandings and tensions in the workplace between the two generations, especially when the presbyter and the immediate person come from different expectations of their work.</p><p>Many new employees want their employer to determine for them their progress - a career path that will gradually enable them to reach a level of pay that will enable them to maintain their new families. How can your business respond to the needs of newcomers, keeping the best of them?</p><p>&nbsp;You should first understand their background and personalize their work accordingly. Young people know about the contraction in the experience of their parents. They have accepted the reality that sometimes it is not certain in the business world. So, they believe in their own <span lang=\"EN-US\">skills. If there is a group for which modifying work or assigning a \"tire\" project is not just a good but necessary idea, this group is the inactive workers.</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN\">Also, employees that are above 50 years old need attention for two reasons. First, in some companies they represent a good percentage of employees. Secondly, mature workers have extensive knowledge and rich business experience, so they are a big part of the intellectual capital of each company. Many have qualifications, such as credibility, patience or impartial qualifications, acquired only through their daily, multiannual engagement in the performance of their duties.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN\">In order to keep these employees to your company, you may need to create a workplace where the usual practices in terms of job description, hours, earnings, and so on are removed. Remember these tips:</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN\">Ask mature workers what their needs are, give them flexibility, m</span>ake their work more interesting, and adjust the pay system.</p><p><span lang=\"EN\">Companies cannot scorn the talent they have because they are different from the rest of the people .Every talented employee is valuable and finding ways to stay in the company has business sense.</span></p><p><br></p>"

		"description" : "<p>Marketing-based employees’ retention strategy requires redesigning work personalization, strengthening social ties and hiring people with the least mobility. Linking employees who may leave with the job opportunities that appear within the company is still a clever tool in their quest to preserve them.</p><p>Another way is by adopting new salary plans. Those employees consider that remuneration is not a remarkable strategy for retaining staff. Remuneration is important in the sense that you cannot attract or retain the employees you desire if the latter consider their remuneration to be unfair or uncompetitive. Even people who are more interested in their profession and less money are aware of their own as an indication that the company values their connotation and their abilities. If they feel underestimated<span lang=\"EL\">,&nbsp;</span>they&nbsp;will&nbsp;leave<span lang=\"EL\">.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN\">However, remuneration is not a credible motive. Incentives often used by employers, including wage increases result in the best possible temporary improvement in performance. It is clear that other strategies are more adept at conservation issues. You must gradually pay out the bonuses you have <span lang=\"EN\">agreed. For example, bonuses are paid to the new CEO within 5 years.&nbsp;</span></span></p><p><span lang=\"EN\">Remuneration is of great importance. However, as a matter of keeping staff, it is easier to manage it more easily than corporate culture. Here are some strategies for setting up a proper pay system:</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN\">See what salaries your sector offers: You can assign this work to an advisory firm or apply the following economical options:</span></p><p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span lang=\"EN\">Locate registered adsonline</span></p><p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span lang=\"EN\">Get in touch with people working in search engines</span></p><p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span lang=\"EN\">Consult professionalc ouncils</span></p><p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span lang=\"EN\">Consider Internal Wage Disparities: Ensure that the pay for each job is broadly the same as that for similar jobs across the company.</span></p><p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span lang=\"EN\">Do not feel surpassed by your competitors: Just make sure that you can meet the most important needs of your employees</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN\">Redesigning the job isanother retention strategy. If you can identify those elements that satisfy but also embarrass a worker in a particular position, then you are able to completely remove the unpleasant places and assign them to other people whowill appreciate them. Think about it. What aspects of this work are unhappy with employees?<br>If we remove the unacceptable seating from that position, we should add something else to consider the position holographic and what is it?<br>Assuming that someone has to take up the unpredictable tasks which alternatives are there for their handling.<br>What does it cost more for the company, the redesign of the position or theexisting rate of renewal shown by this workplace?</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN\">Companies are almost always trying to match people with jobs. Written job descriptions and workplace scheduling analyze in detail the tasks and the rendered performance by dictating where, when and how the work will be <span lang=\"EN\">done. The expectation is that people will comply with descriptions of where, when, and how, which inreality can be highly arbitrary.</span></span></p><p><span lang=\"EN\">To understand the power of personalization, study the aspect of the economy for products and services. <span lang=\"EN\">In this area, competitive markets have led businesses to provide personalized up to a pointof products. Personalization is a powerful tool in any market where demand is less than supply, including the labor market. To personalize a job to meet the needs of both the company and the workers, think about what, where and how thisparticular position</span>.</span></p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"<p><span lang=\" en\"=\"\"></a></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>"

		"title" : "Managing employees who perform poorly in their work",
		"description" : "<p>Each company has individuals whose performance varies; while not all employees are capable of promotion. At the top, there are people whose performance is rated A, meaning their contribution is excellent. Those who score B are doing a good job and people with a grade C do a job that is just acceptable.&nbsp;</p><p>The contribution of the groups to the profit increase differs significantly. On average, A-rated managers increase the company's profits. <span lang=\"EN\">C-rated managers in the same companies did not achieve profits. This raises the question as to where resources should be concentrated on the development of Sigurur career skills, investing in the development of A and B performance individuals are perfectly reasonable. But does it stand with C-rated people? Doyou have to invest in their growth or simply remove them?</span></p><p>Some companies periodically degrade managers with performance C, while others try to make them fall. But most do nothing to deal with the problem. The cost of this indifference is high both from the point of departure of good employees and from the lack of profit growth.<br>Every C-rated person has a role and hence prevents the progress and evolution of the rest of the people in the company. At the same time, those who perform for C are usually not good nor are they good mentors for others.</p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Some s</span><span lang=\"EN\">olutions to combat this problem</span></p><p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span lang=\"EN\">Recognize people with C score performance. Iti s certain that some of these individuals can substantially improve their performance if they are given the direction and educational support they require. At this point, the types of skills and the quality of training can bring significant results.</span></p><p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<span lang=\"EN\">Make managers responsible for improving or removing people with moderate performance. People with a C performance can run off a company and should therefore be removed into low-level positions where they can be eliminated in A-rated individuals. If they fail to improve on preparing for these new posts, they consider that the interest of the company would be to expel them.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN\">However, investing in people with moderate performance may worth. The only way to learn if such people deserve the attention of the company is by making an estimate of how much a company's performance would improve if it were able to promote a C-rated person to the next highest levels. What would be the cost in relation to the benefits? Are costs less than the benefits? If the cost outweighs the benefits, then the solution is either to move the person to a place where he or she can respond better or ask him/her to leave the company.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN\">An additional tip that I would like to remember is that you should not hurry to your assessment. You should be careful in examining the performance of your company and take the proper decisions that benefit your company and not only the company’s short-term goals. Think big and outside of the box and you will find what to do with your managers’ performance!</span></p>"

Texts are better left in memory. Note the degree of their importance. Also, make a list of short and long-term jobs. From&nbsp;them&nbsp;create&nbsp;daily&nbsp;lists&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;day<span lang=\"EL\">'</span>s&nbsp;work<span lang=\"EN-US\">.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang=\"EL\">2. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">Prioritization: Determine</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">important</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">from</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">urgency</span>. <span lang=\"EN-US\">Urgency has a direct and significant effect.

Many keep their best form for trivial things. Keep the routine work for the moment you are tired.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang=\"EL\">4. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">Productive wait: Think about the time spent in <span lang=\"EN-US\">in waiting.

That is why we have usually avoided setting a deadline for our work. Good tactics is to break big projects into smaller ones and until we feel comfortable we get started.

Preventive anxiety is worse than action. Ask yourself why you are late. There is a lack of information, a lack of self-confidence, a lack of stimulation or a starting point. Indecision is the greatest \"time thief\". Making it now saves time and effort. In the case of 95% lack of information there will be no better information in the future. If you need additional information, take a shot to get them</span>.</p><p>8. Organizing your place: A place for every thing and every thing in its place. Archiving saves time. Horizontal archiving is more effective than vertical. The mountain of papers in the office usually consists of things that you will decide later, you do not like doing it, you hope they will disappear, and they are difficult to be handled.</p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Following the previous rules will help to create the time you need to protect. If you are exhausted, it is unlikely to work effectively. Take care of yourself, find time to rest and do not face life as a continuous fight. No one wrote in the funeral plaque \"I would like to spend more time in the office”.</span></p><p><br></p>"

		"title" : "Customer satisfaction measurement systems ",
		"description" : "<p>The design of customer satisfaction measurement systems is a matter of particular specifications since the disclosure of results internally and externally raises a number of requirements that should be met. Let’s see eight points that are the main features of a successful customer satisfaction measurement system.</p><p>1. Emphasis on integrated measurement systems: Oneof the features of customer satisfaction measurement systems should be their integrated character. This means that the internal quality indicators assessed at the same time with customer satisfaction indicators and that allcustomers contact points are covered. An integrated quality indicator system includes both measurement and coordination issues between definitions, methodologies and implementation procedures on a case-by-case basis.&nbsp;</p><p>2. Developing valid methodological frameworks: Customer satisfaction measurement is based on valid methodological frameworks that are developed by specialized executives to measure customer satisfaction as well as link it to other business concepts, such as customer loyalty, and profitability. Customer satisfaction measurement is implemented on a number of occasions with\"discounts\" on the completeness and reliability of the methodology. This includes designing surveys, designing questionnaires, sampling, how to collect data, quality control of the survey and finally, analysis of the results.&nbsp;</p><p>3. Separation between design, implementation, and assurance of customersatisfaction measurement systems: In most cases, the development of customer satisfaction measurement systems is a result of collaboration between the quality directorates of the respective bodies, specialized consultants for planning and, finally, research firms undertaking the implementation of the surveys. Accordingly to each case, there are variations in the exact way this tripartite schemeworks, but in any case there is a clear separation between the discrete components of customer satisfaction measurement systems.&nbsp;</p><p>4. Emphasis on setting upcontact points between telecoms and customers: The measurement of customer satisfaction indicators should cover the presence of multiple points of contact between the business and customers. In most businesses, one can measure satisfaction metrics per contact point, such as pre-sale, sales, product and service provision, after-sales service, scheduled visits, and emergency service. It is also needed to add the need for different measurements in relation to the type of business customers.</p><p>5.Adjustment: Customer satisfaction measurement should not be based solely on \"global standards\" and so, in spite of the similarities between different systems, customer satisfaction measurement systems need to be adapted to each country and to any business. Also, customer satisfaction measurement systems are constantly adapted and updated to respond to ever-changing market conditions</p><p>6.Proactive - Timelessness: Customer satisfaction measurement should include proactive prevention issues before they become bulk and presented to the majority of business customers. In addition, measurements should be timely so that the firm to be able to monitor the evolution of its\"relationship\" with customers beyond and along with its sales progress.</p><p>7.Integration of the system into the general business culture: Customer satisfaction measurement should be integrated into the overall customer service plan, and therefore what is of great importance is the optimal use of measurements in the direction of improving customer service. This means practically that the development of customer satisfaction measurement systems, after a period of validity and dynamism, are policy tools inside the organization both for allocating resources to different agency activities and for targeting at the operational level and administrative units.</p>"

		"title" : "Employees’ exhaustion and how to deal with it",
		"description" : "<p>Exhaustion is the stress from work. Sometimes it is due to the individual but in many cases, it is the result of the culture that prevails in the workplace. Exhaustion usually occurs through lower job satisfaction, less commitment to the company, and increased willingness to do something different. In some cases, you will also see the following warning signs: reduced self-esteem, a decline in the feeling of being able to achieve it, and a neutral or negative attitude towards colleagues and customers.&nbsp;</p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Exhaustion is generally the result of long-term involvement in situations with negative characteristics, such as excessive workload, conflicting requirements, unclear objectives, monotonous work, interpersonal conflicts, minimal reward, minimal recognition of employee contributions, failure to achieve clear success.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Therefore, exhaustion is not only a function of the number of hours worked. Someone can work countless hours and still feel motivated. Unfortunately, most people runout when they feel more pressure and have no support in their working life.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Exhaustion can directly undermine your company's efforts to maintain your employees and if the company gets the reputation of exhausting its employees it will face the problem of not recruiting good employees. Even worse, the more active workers, ie those who are highly committed to their work are even more vulnerable to exhaustion.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Sometimes, some managers contribute to the problem of exhaustion without realizing it. Most tend to load all major tasks to the few people whose performance is top notch. And then when these successors accomplish it with one project, the managers immediately charge them with many projects.</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Some strategies to combat this problem are intelligent staff management, exhaustion management and tactical re-engagement of your top talents.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Intelligent Human Resource Management: One way to avoid excessive workload for employees is to create a long-term, staffed personnel management plan that ensures that there are enough employees who fit with the job. Here's how:</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">Have production supervisors to work closely to human resources and senior management in order to define a staff management strategy that meets the needs of the department and the company.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">Make sure that the staff is properly trained. People who are properly prepared for their work are more likely to be exhausted.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">Arrange the workload: If your department has a particular staff shortage and has no capacity to increase its potential, keep a strategy on employee requirements. Assess a job based on the value it adds to customers.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Managing exhaustion: Another way to avoid the high cost of excessive workload is to minimize managers the work-related stress. Here are some things that can be done:</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">Regularly check your workload, especially top-performing employees.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">Show your appreciation of the valuable workers.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">If a valuable employee shows signs of exhaustion, take a look at the job description. The positions and responsibilities of his/her position may exceed the capabilities of even an excellent employee. In these cases, talk to the human resources department and your staff by redesigning your job.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EL\">· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN\">Above all, be a shrewd observer and a goodlistener.&nbsp;</span></p><p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Re-attracting your top talent: Do not take your valuable employees for granted or suppose that they will always want to continue working for you. Remember that the job market for some specialties is quite profitable and provides great mobility for top employees. Consider that at times you have to reclaim these people. Identify people with top performance and then:</p><p>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Remember to yourself that your best employees are a potential target of your competitors.</p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Show to your hired workers how much they appreciate them and give them little but essentially symbolic gratitude gifts or bonuses.</span></p>"

		"title" : "Boeing 737-Max raises Questions..",
		"description" : "<p>As airlines and safety regulators worldwide scramble to understand why two Boeing 737 Max 8 jets crashed in chillingly similar accidents, more indications are pointing to how an automated anti-stalling system may be linked to the model's unusually deadly debut. The safety feature— the <strong>Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS</strong><strong>)</strong>—appears to have sent both planes into their fatal dives as pilots struggled to keep aloft. The 737 Max 8 and 9 were grounded by regulators around the world last week.</p><p><img class=\"fr-dib fr-draggable\" src=\"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/atg-storage-s3/assets/Frontend/images/article_image/feature_inside-0339000000201991732734.png\" data-error=\"0\"></p><p><br>Here are key details that have been reported — about a series of engineering, regulatory, and political missteps that preceded software being installed on a widely used plane without pilots apparently fully understanding its risks.</p><p><strong>&gt; NEW PLANES BUT NO NEW TRAINING</strong></p><p>Boeing designed the 737 Max 8 to be similar enough to existing 737s that it could keep the same “type rating”—meaning, that pilots who already flew 737s wouldn’t have to be retrained on a new plane and airlines would save a lot of money.</p><p>Yet the Max 8 is different from previous 737s in one major way:</p><p><em>It has larger engines placed farther forward on its wings. The new design increased the risk that the plane could stall if pilots angled the nose too high. To counteract this risk, Boeing introduced the MCAS, which automatically nudges the nose down if onboard sensors detect that the plane risks stalling.</em></p><p>The software is designed to work automatically and only in extreme situations. Boeing decided pilots didn’t need any new training to understand MCAS.</p><p><strong>&gt; Failure of FAA Oversight</strong></p><p>The US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), along with European aviation regulators, sets the tone for much of the world's flight safety standards. Boeing did much of the work of certifying that the 737 Max 8 was safe to fly. FAA managers pressured safety engineers to delegate more and more of the safety analysis to Boeing to get the plane approved faster. In some cases, FAA engineers didn’t even read the technical documents Boeing sent them.</p><p><img class=\"fr-dib fr-draggable\" src=\"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/atg-storage-s3/assets/Frontend/images/article_image/feature_inside-03380000002019912142841.png\" data-error=\"0\"></p><p><strong>&gt; Warning Lights Optional</strong></p><p>Boeing designed a warning light that would alert pilots when the sensors measuring their plane’s angle of attack differed widely, which would give notify them of a faulty MCAS activation. The manufacturer does not install the warning light as a standard feature on the 737 Max 8. Airlines have to pay extra for this.</p><p><strong>&gt; US Govt. Shutdown delays a Software Fix</strong></p><p>After the Lion Air crash in October 2018, Boeing promised a software patch to make the MCAS safer by January. The fix has since been delayed until April because of “engineering challenges,” “differences of opinion” between federal and Boeing officials.</p><p><strong>&gt; Ceding more controls to the Computer</strong></p><p>The safety analysis Boeing sent to the FAA reported that the MCAS could only move the plane’s horizontal tail 0.6 degrees (out of a physical maximum of a little less than five degrees). But during later flight tests, Boeing discovered that 0.6 degrees of movement wasn’t enough to avert a high speed stall. Despite quadrupling the amount that the MCAS could move the plane’s tail, Boeing never updated the documents it sent to the FAA.</p><p>Now,Boeing also plans to train pilots on the system and mention the MCAS in flight manuals.</p><p><br></p>"

		"title" : "The Web as a distribution channel",
		"description" : "<p>The Web as a new form of distribution channel has revolutionized the methods of transmitted the goods from the supplier to the final customer introducing a new age in the field of marketing.&nbsp;</p><p>There are many advantages of using the Web asa distribution channel to the supply of the products and services. First of all, a Web distribution channel can approach many users and ship mass productsin different nations without having much expenditure. This entails a great expansion of the brand and an increasing number of customers who are aware of the companies’ facilities and its product’s benefits due to the brand promotion and advertising on the Web. In fact, Web allows people to have access to goods that cannot usually find in their own country, as most sites that sell goods ship them all over the world. Moreover, Web distributional channels reach new larger markets and contribute to the better collaboration between the companies leading to better prices and effective supply chain. Besides, it is commonly known that a company that is interested in expanding its operation in foreign markets needs significant consultation of the local distributors who are well-informed about the customer’s demand and preferences. Therefore, Web can be of their best assistant, as it eliminates the money waste and the time needed to approach such distributors so as to acquire important information.&nbsp;</p><p>Another benefit is that it functions everyday 24 hours a day; therefore increasing the possibility of augmenting its sales given that there are lots of people that prefer to buy online due to the lack of their free time. Also, the fact that manufacturers can cut down on retail expenses, make products available at a lower price than the price of products that launched in a shop. A direct consequence of this is the increased demand, as each company can target in a larger customer base taking advantage of this pricing strategy. &nbsp;</p><p>From companies’ perspective, Web facilitates the businesses to evaluate the resultsof internet marketing and measure the customer’s preferences by providing platforms that customers can give feedbacks or conduct research and measure traffic to the website. Hence, it becomes easier for a company to know more about the needs and habits of the consumers in a specific region and adjust its marketing strategies to them. Nevertheless, this knowledge and specialization are really precious to create a strong relationship between the company and the customers as it minimizes the consumers that feel left outfrom the distribution channel. As a matter of fact, companies do not need tocreate a new distribution channel but they can use the existed in which they invest a logic amount of money for that.</p><p>On the other hand, there are some particular disadvantages of using the Web as a distribution channel. One of the many disadvantages is that this distribution channel is usually very complicated and little flexible within its structure and for this reason, it creates delays within the distribution procedure. Due to the sophistication that it includes,it is very difficult for a company to supervise the selling environment and implement an alternative strategy if the customer’s habits change because they have not adequate and accurate personalized information. Also, it can pose potential channel conflict due to the multiple channels involved, something that needs a daily supervisor and activity so as to prevent misunderstanding, hacking about the product and the brand. At the same time, the Web needs many intermediaries who should be paid for these services leading to an increase in the product/service price which is burdened the final consumer. Moreover, they may have different strategic goals, a fact that may create conflicts during the distribution procedure causing loss of a harmonizer environment due to operational inefficiencies. This is because resellers are free to make changes to things injuring the image of the supplier.</p>"

		"description" : "<p>Standard costing is utilized for determining the costs of direct materials, direct labor, and overheads needed to be produced product units in a specific fiscal year. This information is recorded in a report and presents the costs that a company expects if a particular (ideal or attainable) strategy is succeeded.&nbsp;</p><p>Standard costs of materials (standard quantity and standard price), labor(standard hours and standard rate), and overheads (standard rate and standardquantity) are values that helps decisively the budget determination process and the variance analysis, as they function as a starting point of companies’ financial performance evaluation which in turn facilitates the manager to achieve better costs controlling and a restriction to variances; for this reason it is prepared before the other cost analysis procedures in relation to expected operation conditions. In particular, the material costs are defined by the contracts that the company signs to buy the raw materials in relation to the inflation, while the labor costs are set from the contracts between the employees and the company, as well as from the legal rules that require the minimum level of wages so as to secure the rights of the employees. Also,overheads are predestined from the data acquired by companies’ previous experience adjusted to the inflation or from expected costs due to the operational changes. &nbsp;</p><p>The main purpose of standard costing systems is the arrangement of a company’s operating activities, as well as the efficacy of companies’ decisions regarding the number of costs and the company’s profits. To be more specific, standard costs are compared with the actual costs at the end of the fiscal year by applying a variance analysis. A successful managerial decision should be lead in a balance between the standard costs and the actual costs realizing the decision and the objectives that the company sets. Also, given that standard costs relates to the cost allocation, it can be used along with other costing methods, such as the job order costing system and the process costing system to appropriate allocate materials, work in process, and finished goods inventories with the view to simplifying costing procedures, encouraging cost reduction and fixing the company’s prices.&nbsp;</p><p>Another purpose ofusing standard costs is to ensure better financial performance in the long runby motivating and calculating employee’s and managers’ efficiencies. In fact, the standard cost report “communicates” with employees by giving them guidelines that should be followed. To be more specific, employees are able to be informed about the consequences of the lack of job performance and production efficacy and the rewards that will be given in the case of high job performance.&nbsp;</p><p>Simultaneously, it assists managers to apply the predetermined company’s strategy and facilitates the administration of human resources. Also, it is crucial for the production policy, as it contributes to being constructed a flexible budget, evaluates the dynamics of workforce and shows which are as are not productive. Finally, the standard costs prepare the managers and the employees to be ready for the actual production and informed about the strategy of the company enabling them to focus on a certain objective that should be achieved, hence facilitates their job and urges savings. However, the company should revise the standard costing reports at a regular base so as to see if changes emerged and thus alter the data given eventually achieving a better position for the challenges in the marketplace.</p>"

		"title" : "Socio-economic Transformation",
		"description" : "<p>India is in the middle of a historical election which is noteworthy in many respects, one of them being the unprecedented focus on women’s employment.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>What Data shows ?</strong></p><p><br></p><p>Currently, the participation of women in the workforce in India is one of the lowest globally. The female Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR) in India fell from 31.2% in 2011-2012 to 23.3% in 2017-2018. This decline has been sharper in rural areas, where the female LFPR fell by more than 11 percentage points in 2017-2018. The answers can be found in a complex set of factors including low social acceptability of women working outside the household, lack of access to safe and secure workspaces, widespread prevalence of poor and unequal wages, and a dearth of decent and suitable jobs. Most women in India are engaged in subsistence-level work in agriculture in rural areas, and in low-paying jobs such as domestic service and petty home-based manufacturing in urban areas.</p><p><img class=\"fr-dib fr-draggable\" src=\"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/atg-storage-s3/assets/Frontend/images/article_image/feature_inside-054400000020191665069346.png\" data-error=\"0\"></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Education and Work</strong></p><p><br></p><p>A recent study observed a strong negative relationship between a woman’s education level and her participation in agricultural and non-agricultural wage work and in family farms. The study also showed a preference among women for salaried jobs as their educational attainment increases; but such jobs remain extremely limited for women. It is estimated that among people (25 to 59 years) working as farmers, farm labourers and service workers, nearly a third are women, while the proportion of women among professionals, managers and clerical workers is only about 15% (NSSO, 2011-2012).&nbsp;</p><p><em>Time-use surveys</em> have found that they devote a substantial amount of their time to work which is not considered as work, but an extension of their duties, and is largely unpaid. The incidence and drudgery of this unpaid labour is growing. This includes unpaid care work such as childcare, elderly care, and household work such as collecting water. The burden of these activities falls disproportionately on women, especially in the absence of adequately available or accessible public services.</p><p><br></p><p>Any government which is serious about ensuring women’s economic empowerment and equal access to livelihoods must address the numerous challenges that exist along this highly gendered continuum of unpaid, underpaid and paid work.</p><p><br></p><p>Women have also expressed the need for policies which ensure safe and dignified working and living conditions for migrant workers. For example, in cities, governments must set up migration facilitation and crisis centres (temporary shelter facility, helpline, legal aid, and medical and counselling facilities).</p>"

These changes can be beneficial for some others but not for all of us. Especially when these changes are related to business or those who make a living from it. These changes have benefited consumers most. Giving them a chance to make choices and to select those choices which they think will benefit them the most.

/></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not one such area might have been left which has not been affected by the advancement of technology. The field which is most widely affected by it is transportation. Now, passengers do not have to wait near the taxi stand to hire a taxi. With just a click of a button, they can book the cab. And the cab will pick up from the desired places. Don&rsquo;t you think it is convenient? Yes, it is very convenient. You don&rsquo;t have to do anything at all. This will not only save your time but also relieves you from the tension at waiting at the taxi stand in long queues. All of this is happening with the help of your phone. The company that is providing at the top position currently and is providing taxi services all over the world is Uber. Uber is the cab service provider company. The drivers who are registered with Uber give their services to the passengers who order a cab from Uber.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another company that provides the cab services unlike Uber is the Ola cab services it works the same way as Uber. They both are providing cab services throughout the world. But Uber is more famous than Ola. The other taxi service provider companies have been affected by it. It seems that local taxi drivers are not affected much as it seems. They had affected but only a little. Only the taxi service provider companies other than Uber and Ola have been affected much by it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img class=\"fr-dib fr-draggable\" src=\"https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRBwnl0N2EZP4ggdioZltJBCKzh-t90r3-Gh7A8M-VwVloHco3l\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The surveys done by the Forbes tell that Uber taxi drivers earn more than the other taxi drivers. Because of the increase in competition many taxi drivers have joined with Uber to provide their services to the consumers. As the competition is increased other taxi service provider companies are finding other ways so that they can compete with Uber.</p>\r\n"

		"description" : "<p>Jet Airways may have finally run out of runway. Two months after Jet halted all flight operations, lenders to the beleaguered full service airline have decided to refer it to the National Company Law Tribunal and initiate insolvency proceedings in a bid to recover the money owed to them. The lenders’ consortium arrived at this conclusion after unsuccessfully trying to rope in a white knight — an investor who would have helped put the airline’s flights back in the air, thus saving thousands of jobs and potentially helping turn around the carrier. And while, theoretically, the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code was conceived to help achieve a resolution that could potentially protect a running business and help revive it through capital restructuring under a new promoter, in Jet’s case the chances of a resolution seem rather remote now. The lenders have to shoulder a fair share of the blame as the delay in initiating the insolvency process has drastically eroded some of the airline’s key assets, including customer goodwill, its aircraft fleet, routes and landing slots and even its experienced flight crew.</p><p><img class=\"fr-dib fr-draggable\" src=\"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/atg-storage-s3/assets/Frontend/images/article_image/feature_inside-07020000002019390285073.png\" data-error=\"0\"></p><p><br></p><p><em>Ironically, while the banks may have viewed Jet’s request for emergency lines of credit in the run-up to the suspension of operations as ‘good money chasing bad money’, nothing could potentially kill an airline more effectively than protracted grounding.</em> And one doesn’t even need to look too far back in time to recall what happened to Kingfisher Airlines.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><em>It would surely have been instructive for the creditors to revisit the Chapter 11 bankruptcies that a clutch of U.S. legacy airlines opted for in the early 2000s. That protection helped Delta and United to not only survive the crisis of confidence in aviation triggered by the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the surge in jet fuel and labour costs and the intense competition from low-cost carriers, but emerge stronger and rank among the top five contemporary American carriers.</em> A look at some of Jet’s industry-specific operational metrics, at least until the recent cash-starved implosion, show an airline that had consistently posted growth in terms of revenue passenger kilometres and cargo tonnage till the 2017-18 financial year. So it wasn’t a lack of business that led to Jet’s stall and crash. For the health of India’s airline industry, it will be crucial for policymakers to review several issues that affect viability: from the way aviation turbine fuel is taxed, to the charges airports levy.</p><p><img class=\"fr-dib fr-draggable\" src=\"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/atg-storage-s3/assets/Frontend/images/article_image/feature_inside-07230000002019815215088.png\" data-error=\"0\"></p><p><br></p><p><em>The carriers too need to reappraise their pricing strategies and ensure that in the quest for market share they don’t end up in a race to the bottom</em>.

As a business owner, you need to focus on fire risk assessment, fire prevention, and staff education so you can help reduce the risk of a fire occurring and help to mitigate the damage if it does.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Fire Risk Assessment</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fire safety codes must be in place for businesses. You should contact your local fire marshal and schedule a visit for your business so they can help you make sure safety codes are met, and an effective fire prevention plan is in place. Property managers should have a fire escape route clearly defined for the building, so be sure that it is posted in your work area. You can also use the National Fire Protection Association&rsquo;s website for further information and publications on the fire safety code for businesses. Keeping your place of business in line with fire safety codes will greatly reduce the risk of fires.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Fire Prevention And Protection</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Standard fire safety practices call for smoke detectors and fire extinguishers on every floor of the building. Automatic sprinkler systems are also a great tool to provide primary protection for your business in case of a fire. Emergency equipment kits should also be available in your workplace to provide items such as bottled water, flashlights, and escape masks to fight against smoke inhalation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Fire Safety Education For Staff And Employees</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Educating employees and staff on how to respond in the wake of fire will greatly increase the odds of everyone getting out of the building safely and quickly. Here are some ways you should educate employees about fire safety:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Have a fire escape plan in place, and make sure your employees are informed and rehearsed on how it works. Post the fire escape routes in areas that can be seen by all building occupants. Conduct a fire drill at least once a year to keep employees practiced and aware of the fire escape plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Designate an office fire safety and prevention officer. Their duties will include composing escape routes that are in compliance with the building manager, designate safe meeting points outside of the building, and offer scheduled fire safety training and education for fellow employees. They will also be sure that fire prevention information and practices are up to date and in compliance with business safety codes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Install an automatic sprinkler system in your building. Sprinkler systems are cost-effective and have proven to be the best way to fight the spread of a commercial fire. The National Fire Protection Association reported that properly installed and maintained sprinkler systems are 95% effective in commercial fires.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;Make sure all employees know how to activate the emergency response system in your building. Most commercial fire alarms alert local authorities and fire departments when they go off, but it is still good practice to be sure that all employees know how to alert emergency personnel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you find your commercial property damaged by fire or smoke, you can contact the professional fire damage restoration team at Design Builders in Las Vegas 24 hours a day! we also provides professional services for <strong><a href=\"https://designbuildersconstruction.com/commercial-construction/\">commercial construction in Las Vegas</a></strong>.</p>\r\n"

The success of a business or an industry is determined by the leaders it chooses or inherits. How does someone earn the designation of being a great leader? One of the greatest things about leadership is that everyone bring something different to the table. If we were to read articles on good leadership qualities, we would usually see factors like integrity, effective communication and influence. These are wonderful qualities of a leader.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Leader is focused much more on the individual capability of the leader: &quot;Leadership is a function of knowing yourself, having a vision that is well communicated, building trust among colleagues, and taking effective action to realize your own leadership potential.&quot;(Warren Bennis)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One such leader is a lady superstar, a CEO &nbsp;of a fortune 500 bussiness entity. we discuss today &nbsp;here is about Ms. Indira Nooyi, CEO Pepsico India. Indira Krisnamurthy Nooyi, the 62 year-old, chennai-born, Nooyi, was in 2006 appointed as the first female boss of the $63.5 billion turnover company where she has spent over two decades by now. Over the years she became a flag bearer for working women striving to balance the personal with the professional life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nooyi has been vocal about the extraordinary leadership traits Indians bring to organisations. An ability to live in a &quot;volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous world&quot; makes Indians more resilient and flexible to change, she feels. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A graduate of Indian Institute of Management Calcutta and later &nbsp;Yale, Nooyi is credited with earning top degrees, mostly unknown for women in India of her times. Nooyi credits India&#39;s pedigreed education system for picking out strong leaders. She has consistently ranked among the world&#39;s 100 most powerful women in 2014, she was ranked number 13 on the forbes list of the world&#39;s 100 most powerful women, and was ranked the 2nd most powerful woman on Fortune list in 2015.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nooyi believes in constant reinvention. &quot;The minute you&#39;ve developed a new business model, it&#39;s extinct, because somebody is going to copy it.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nooyi who is from India, is the first foreign-born CEO of pepsi and the first woman to lead the chips-and-soda company. Her departure thins the ranks of female CEOs running S&amp;P 500 companies and comes at a time when Pepsi&#39;s North American beverage unit is stagnating amid a general decline in soda consumption. In 24 years at Pepsi, including 12 years as chief executive, she has helped the Frito-Lay unit grow in a challenging industry and added healthier drinks and snacks to portfolio that includes cheetos and Mountain Dew.</p>\r\n"

Then again, on the off chance that they have low desires for an organization and are agreeably astonished, they may feel more fulfilled than if they had exclusive standards and feel they have been let down. Strangely, organizations are not constantly ready to precisely foresee what clients will anticipate from them, and frameworks of social occasion and breaking down input are normally essential.</p><p>Regularly, a client's level of fulfillment is reliant on the desires he has for an organization. For instance, on the off chance that he anticipates that an organization will offer to incite benefit, however, he experiences delays in the preparing of his request, he may feel unsatisfied. In like manner, in the event that he trusts an organization will give a quality item and his buy appears to be economically made, he may feel troubled. Moreover, a client may feel disappointed with an organization in the event that he trusts his business is esteemed, yet an organization demonstrates generally by enabling its representatives to disregard him, carry on impolitely, or neglect to react fittingly to dissensions.</p><p>Much of the time, client expectations and satisfaction are impacted by the promotions an organization uses to offer its items or administrations. For instance<em>, if an organization promotes that it forms arranges inside a specific time allotment yet then neglects to satisfy this, its clients are probably going to feel misdirected by the ad and disappointed.</em> In like manner, if an organization publicizes itself as putting client benefit first, yet then shows just a normal level of worry here, its clients are probably going to be less fulfilled. In such cases, the association between client expectations and satisfaction is one the organization affected with its promoting claims.</p><p>Some of the time a client's own particular assumptions about an organization — irrelevant to promoting — can likewise influence the connection between client desires and fulfillment. For instance, if a client trusts an organization has the ability to rapidly and precisely analyze a hardware issue, yet the organization can't give an analysis immediately, the client may feel let down<em>. The same may remain constant if the client anticipates that an organization will acknowledge exceptional requests however it declines to do as such.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>Numerous organizations wrongly try to meet accepted desires instead of realizing what the clients' desires truly are.</em> On the off chance that the desires are expected, the organization's needs may appear to be off center because of the way that does not by any stretch of the imagination comprehend what its clients need or consider generally basic. In such cases and in light of the connection between client desires and fulfillment, finding compelling techniques for checking client needs may demonstrate basic for the organization's prosperity.</p>"

		"title" : "Love Networking",
		"description" : "<p>\"I hate networking.”&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://www.businessknowhow.com/uploads/hatenetworking-500.jpg\" alt=\"Image result for hate business networking\" class=\"fr-draggable\" style=\"width: 307px; height: 205.69px;\"><br></p><p>We hear this all the time from executives, other professionals, and MBA students. They tell us that networking makes them feel uncomfortable and phony—even dirty. Although some people have a natural passion for it—namely, the extroverts who love and thrive on social interaction—many understandably see it as brown-nosing, exploitative, and inauthentic.</p><p>But in today’s world, networking is a necessity. A mountain of research shows that professional networks lead to more job and business opportunities, broader and deeper knowledge, improved capacity to innovate, faster advancement, and greater status and authority. Building and nurturing professional relationships also improves the quality of work and increases job satisfaction.</p><p>Fortunately, research shows that an aversion to networking can be overcome.&nbsp;</p><p>Most people have a dominant motivational focus—what psychologists refer to as either a “promotion” or a “prevention” mindset. Those in the former category think primarily about the growth, advancement, and accomplishments that networking can bring them, while those in the latter see it as something they are obligated to take part in for professional reasons.</p><p>Thankfully, as Stanford University’s Carol Dweck has documented in her research, it’s possible to shift your mindset from prevention to promotion, so that you see networking as an opportunity for discovery and learning rather than a chore.</p><p>If you are an introvert, you can’t simply will yourself to be extroverted, of course. But everyone can choose which motivational focus to bring to networking.&nbsp;</p><p>The next step in making networking more palatable is to think about how your interests and goals align with those of people you meet and how that can help you forge meaningful working relationships. Numerous studies in social psychology have demonstrated that people establish the most collaborative and longest-lasting connections when they work together on tasks that require one another’s contributions.</p><p><img src=\"http://arkansasconsumer.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/iStock_000021374992XSmall-network.jpg\" alt=\"Image result for business networking\" class=\"fr-draggable\" style=\"width: 312px; height: 238.727px;\"><br></p><p>When your networking is driven by substantive, shared interests you’ve identified through serious research, it will feel more authentic and meaningful and is more likely to lead to relationships that have those qualities too.</p><p>Even when you do not share an interest with someone, you can probably find something valuable to offer by thinking beyond the obvious. Of course, this isn’t always easy. We’ve found that people who feel powerless—because they are junior in their organizations, because they belong to a minority, or for other reasons—often believe they have too little to give and are therefore the least likely to engage in networking, even though they’re the ones who will probably derive the most benefit from it.</p><p>This problem was highlighted in two studies we conducted at the law firm mentioned above, which involved different groups of lawyers at different points in time. We found that senior people were typically much more comfortable networking than junior people were because of their greater power in the organization. This makes sense. When people believe they have a lot to offer others, such as wise advice, mentorship, access, and resources, networking feels easier and less selfish.</p><p>A controlled experiment confirmed this finding: People in whom we induced feelings of power found networking less repulsive and were more willing to do it than people assigned to a condition that made them feel powerless.</p><p>Another factor that affects people’s interest in and effectiveness at networking is the primary purpose they have in mind when they do it. In the law firm we studied, we found that attorneys who focused on the collective benefits of making connections (“support my firm” and “help my clients”) rather than on personal ones (“support or help my career”) felt more authentic and less dirty while networking, were more likely to network, and had more billable hours as a result.</p>"

And in the 21st century all it requires to be a good communicator to stand in the world. Here are some of the sides of the relationship:</p><p><strong>HEALTHY COMMUNICATION</strong></p><p>Normally a communication involves a sender, a receiver and a message. But for healthy communication, there are many factors which need to be there. For eg: Encoding. Encoding is a process of interpreting the message by the receiver. Healthy communication sustains when receiver knows the motive behind your message and he takes an active and rational action. Like a husband says \"sugar jar is empty\". This appears to be a simple statement but here the work of wife is to go and refill the jar. See, the motive and intention matters.</p><p><em><strong>“We speak not only to tell other people what we think but to tell ourselves what we think. Speech is a part of thought.” Oliver Sacks</strong></em></p><p><strong>OVERCOMMUNICATION&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Communication is, of course, a way of telling your emotions but it can be over sometimes. You are speaking the things which the person don't even want to listen or just ask yourself are not you connecting to the person even when it is not required. This happens usually in smartphones world. Some couples are in touch everytime over WhatsApp or facebook etc. This doesn't make the relationship healthy but makes it worse.</p><p><strong>COMMUNICATION IN ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS</strong></p><p>&nbsp;If you are in a &nbsp;romantic relationship, you have spent so much time with our partner that you feel you know them inside-out. It is all about how much you know your partner and how curious you are in knowing them. But after so many years, how can you see your partner in a different light?</p><p>The best and only way is to try this experiment. Talk to your partner in an absurd way. Note down his reactions. Wouldn't you like to be spoken as if you were valued, appreciated and loved no matter what? same is for him/her. Just think, how would you react to someone who thinks so highly of you? Tit for<br>Tat. You will see how romantic relation will sustain forever.</p><p><strong>COMMUNICATION IN LONG DISTANCE RELATIONSHIPS</strong></p><p><em><strong>“If you can’t change it, change the way you think about it.” Mary Engelbreit</strong></em></p><p>It is often believed that long distance relationships are not meant to be forever.

Some stuff are very important for your life which you can&#39;t leave and yes, parties are inevitable but healthy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img class=\"fr-dib fr-draggable\" src=\"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/atg-storage-s3/assets/Frontend/images/article_image/feature_inside-102000000020181755719220.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>SOME UNNECESSARY SITUATIONS(CAN BE AVOID)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>1. &nbsp;Going to cafes every week</strong><strong>&nbsp;:</strong></em><em>:&nbsp;</em>if you have friends that love hanging out every week then you can avoid going with them because(as it is mentioned) it is not typically necessary. You probably such outings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>2. Weddings/Parties etc. :</strong></em> Going to brother&#39; wife&#39;s sister&#39;s aunt&#39;s wedding can never be mandatory because wedding is cool. It can easily be avoided. If you&#39;re an introvert it&#39;s easy to stick to special events of your life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>3. Meet unknown people for dating purposes:</em></strong> If you&#39;re single and don&#39;t want to be then you have to meet new people. That&#39;s how life works but it&#39;s completely okay if you don&#39;t want.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>SOME NECESSARY SITUATION( CAN&quot;T BE AVOIDED)</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>1. Social gatherings at the workplace:&nbsp;</em></strong>work life is not the same as social life. You can avoid going to parties but you must have to attend these gatherings where you can have your golden to impress your boss or improve your contacts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>2. Talk to co-workers:</em></strong> Life is a race but the rat-race does not slow down because you like Netflix more than karaoke. You don&#39;t need to talk to every co-worker but you have to talk on a semi-regular basis in order to advance your career.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>3. Best friend&#39;s party:</em></strong> Introvert too have best friends and their birthdays, OOPS, you can&#39;t at all avoid them. you sister&#39;s wedding or our parents anniversary, these are must go events of your life even if you feel you don&#39;t, Sorry friend, but we all have our social obligations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>4. Your own birthday party:&nbsp;</em></strong>You have birthday, promotions or any other reason to celebrate but you don&#39;t want to shudder and shine, that&#39;s okay but some other want. Your best friend may be planning a big party for your birthday then it&#39;s not okay to have a low-key stimulus to all the arrangements. Obviously, of they wouldn&#39;t want to celebrate with you if they didn&#39;t care.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are not any hard and fast rules for any event to go or not to go. (I have avoided plenty of my birthdays) but some you need to attend in order to free your mind. By giving yourself a specific task will not keep your attention to thumping music and brightening lights.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In effect, the major issue with introverts is that they have to come to the party recharged with their own fuel while extroverts come to the parties and get recharged. Always try to watch movies with social gathering events. F.R.I.E.N.D.S is the biggest example. Always recharge yourself before coming to the party, talk to yourself looking in the mirror. Filling up on you-time before you go to a party is a great way to prepare yourself for socialization, but your tank can still run out before the evening is over. Try to talk to [people in small gaps because as an introvert, other people will hardly care what you think an don&#39;t want to know you until and unless you are not going to tell them. This is a fallacy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&#39;t be a douchebag. It will improve someday but yes, don&#39;t consider yourself a slick person if you are introvert. you are better and best than extroverts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

The business organisation can possess a large amount of information that help them in taking strategic and other important decisions. Companies that translate this information to knowledge and use it in their planning and decision making.</p><p>A benchmark may be defined as a standard or a point of a reference against which thing may be compared and by which something can be measured and judged. However, the term got popularity much later in seventh decade of twentieth century. Initially, the concept evolved in companies operating in an industrial environment. Over a period of time it covered other spheres of business activity. In recent years, different commercial and non-commercial organisations are discovering the value of benchmarking and are applying it to improve their processes and systems.</p><p><strong>What is Benchmarking?</strong></p><p>In simple words, benchmarking is an approach of setting goals and measuring productivity based on best industry practises. It developed out of the need of the need to have information against which performance can be measured.</p><p><em>For example, a customer support engineer of a television company attends a call with in forty-eight hours. If the industry norm is that all calls are attended within twenty four hours, then the twenty four hours can be s benchmark.</em></p><p>Benchmarking helps businesses in improving performance by learning from the best practises and the processes by which they are achieved. Thus, benchmarking is a process of continuous improvement in search for competitive advantage</p><p>Firms can use benchmarking practises to achieve improvements in diverse range of management functions, such as:</p><p><em>* Maintenance operations,</em></p><p><em>* Assessment of total manufacturing costs,</em></p><p><em>* Product development,</em></p><p><em>* Product distribution,</em></p><p><em>* Customer services,</em></p><p><em>* Plant &nbsp;utilisation levels,</em></p><p><em>* Human resource management.</em></p><p><strong>Steps in Benchmarking Process.</strong></p><p><strong>&nbsp;(i) &nbsp;Identifying the need for benchmarking:</strong> This step will define the objectives of the benchmarking exercise. It will also involves selecting the type of benchmarking. Organisations identify realistic opportunities for improvements.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;(ii) &nbsp;Clearly understanding existing decision making processes:</strong> This step involves compiling information and data on performances. This will include mapping processes. Information and data is collected by different &nbsp;methods such as interviews, visits and filing of questionnaires.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>&nbsp;(iii) &nbsp;Identify best processes:&nbsp;</strong>Within the selected framework best processes are identified. These may be within the same organisation or external to them.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;(iv) &nbsp;Comparison of own process and performance with that of others:&nbsp;</strong>Benchmarking process also involves comparison of performance of the organisation with performance of other organisation. Any deviation between the two is analysed to make further improvements. Feasibility of making the improvements in the light of the conditions that apply within the organisation is also examined.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>&nbsp;(v) &nbsp;Prepare a report and implement the steps necessary to close the performance gap:&nbsp;</strong>A report on benchmarking initiatives containing recommendation is prepared. Such a report also contains the action plans for implementation.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;(vi) &nbsp;Evaluation:&nbsp;</strong>Business organisation evaluates the result of benchmarking process in terms of improvements through objectives and other criteria set for the purpose. They also periodically evaluate in the light of changes in that conditions that impact the performance.</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Benchmarking is not a panacea for all problems. Rather, it studies the circumstances and processes that helps in superior performance. Better processes are not merely copied. Efforts are made to learn, improve and evolve them to suit the organizational requirements. Further benchmarking exercises are also repeated periodically so that the organisation does not lag behind in the dynamic environment.&nbsp;</p>"

		"title" : "RIVALRY AND SUBSTITUTES",
		"description" : "<p><strong>The Nature of Rivalry in the Industry.</strong></p><p>The intensity of rivalry in an industry is a significant determinant of industry attractiveness and profitability. The intensity of rivalry can influence the costs of suppliers, distribution, and of attracting customers and thus directly affect the profitability. The more intensive the rivalry, the less attractive is the industry. Rivalry among competitors tends to be cutthroat and industry profitability low when</p><p><em>(i) An industry has no clear leader.</em></p><p><em>(ii) Competitors in the industry are numerous.</em></p><p><em>(iii) Competitors operate with high fixed costs.</em></p><p><em>(iv) Competitors face high exit barriers.</em></p><p><em>(v) Competitors have little opportunity to differentiate their offerings.</em></p><p><em>(vi) The industry faces slow or diminished growth.</em></p><p><strong>(i) Industry Leader :</strong> A strong industry leader can discourage price wars by disciplining initiators of such activity. Because of its greater financial resources, a leader can generally outlast smaller rivals in a price war. Knowing this, smaller rivals often avoid initiating such a contest.</p><p><strong>(ii) Number of Competitors :</strong> Even when an industry leader exists, the leader's ability to exert pricing discipline diminishes with the increased number of rivals in the industry as communicating expectations to players becomes more difficult.</p><p><strong>(iii) Fixed Costs&nbsp;</strong>: When rivals operate with high fixed costs, they feel strong motivation to utilize their capacity and therefore are inclined to cut prices when they have excess capacity. Price cutting causes profitability to fall for all firms in the industry as firms seek to produce more to cover costs that must be paid regardless of industry demand. For this reason, profitability tends to be lower in industries (for example, airline, telecommunications) characterized by high fixed costs.</p><p><strong>(iv) Exit Barriers :</strong> Rivalry among competitors declines if some competitors leave an industry. Profitability therefore tends to be higher industries with few exit barriers. Exit barriers come in many forms. Assets of a firm considering exit may be highly specialised and therefore of little value to any other firm. Such a firm can thus find no buyer for its assets. This discourages exit. When barriers to exit are powerful, competitors desiring exit may refrain from leaving. There continued presence in an industry exerts downward pressure on the profitability of all competitors.</p><p><strong>(v) Product Differentiation&nbsp;</strong>: Firms can sometimes insulate themselves from price war by differentiating their products from those of rivals. As a consequence, profitability tends to be higher in industries that offers opportunity for differentiation. Profitability tends to be lower in industries involving undifferentiated commodities such as, memory chips, natural resources, processed metals and railroads.</p><p><strong>(vi) Slow Growth :</strong> Industries whose growth is slowing down tend to face more intense rivalry. As industry growth slows, rivals must often fight harder to grow or even to keep their existing market shares. The resulting intensive rivalry tends to reduce profitability for all.</p><p><strong>Threat of Substitutes.</strong></p><p>A final force that can influence industry profitability is the availability of substitutes for an industry's product. To predict profit pressure from this source, firm must search for product that perform the same or nearly the same function as their existing products. Real estates, insurance, bonds and bank deposits for example are clear substitutes for common stocks because they represent alternate ways to invest funds.</p><p>The threat of substitutes is great in many high tech industries as well<em>. For example introduction of digital filmless cameras virtually replace the film cameras and threatened the existence of Eastman Kodak and Fuji Film. Further, the introduction of smart phones has replaced cameras to a great extent.</em></p><p><em><img class=\"fr-dib fr-draggable\" src=\"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/atg-storage-s3/assets/Frontend/images/article_image/feature_inside-104400000020182106205412.png\" data-error=\"0\" style=\"width: 322px; height: 230.141px;\"></em>&nbsp;</p>"

		"title" : "THREAT OF NEW ENTRANTS",
		"description" : "<p>A firm's profitability tends to be higher when other firms are blocked &nbsp;from entering the industry. New entrants can reduce industry profitability because they add new production capacity leading to increase supply of the product even at a lower price and can substantially erode existing firm's market share position. To discourage new entrants, existing firms can try to raise barriers to entry. Barriers to entry represent economic forces (or 'hurdles') that slow down or impede entry by other firms. Common barriers to entry include:</p><p><strong>Capital Requirements:</strong> When a large amount of capital is required to enter an industry, firms lacking funds are effectively barred from the industry, thus enhancing the profitability of existing firms in the industry. For example, huge investments are needed to build production facilities and establish brand awareness among people for entry into the pharmaceutical industry. This makes the entry of new companies into this sector very difficult.</p><p><strong>Economies of Scale:</strong> Many industries are characterized by economic activities driven by economies of scale refer to the decline in the per-unit cost of production as volume grows. A large firm that enjoys economies of scale can produce high volumes of goods at successively lower costs. This tends to discourage new entrants. For example, in the semiconductor industry, larger companies, such as IBM, Intel, Samsung and Texas Instruments, enjoy substantial economies of scale in the production of advanced microprocessors, communication chips and integrated circuits that power most consumer electronics, personal computers and cellular phones. This acts as a barrier for new entrants.</p><p><strong>Product Differentiation:</strong> Product differentiation refers to the physical or perceptual differences, or enhancements, that make a product special or unique in the eyes of customers. Firms in the personal care products and cosmetics industries actively engage in product differentiation to enhance their products features. Differentiation works to reinforce entry barriers because the cost of creating genuine product differences may be too high for the new entrants.</p><p><strong>Switching Costs:&nbsp;</strong>To succeed in an industry, new entrant must be able to persuade existing products. To make a switch, buyers may need to test a new firm's product, negotiate new purchase contracts, and train personnel to use the equipment, or modify facilities for product use. Buyers often incur substantial financial costs in switching between firms. When such switching costs are high, buyers are often reluctant to change. For example, high switching costs in moving away from Microsoft's Windows operating systems used in personal computers and corporate servers powered the company's stunning growth over the past decade in the software industry.</p><p><strong>Brand Identity:</strong> The brand identity of product or service offered by existing firms can serve as another entry barrier. Brand identity is particularly important for infrequently purchased products that carry a high unit cost to the buyer. New entrants often encounter significant difficulties in building up the brand identity, because to do so they must commit substantial resources over a long period. For example, during the 1970s, Japanese companies such as Toyota, Nissan, and Honda had to spend huge sums on new product development and promotional activities to overcome the American consumer's preference for domestic cars.</p><p><strong>Access to Distribution Channels: </strong>The unavailability of distribution channels for new entrants poses another significant entry barrier. Despite the growing power of the internet, many firms may continue to rely on their control of physical distribution channels to sustain a barrier to entry to rivals. Often, existing firms have significant influence over the distribution channels and can retard or impede their use by new firms. For example, because of control over distribution channels in India by HUL, P&amp;G and Godrej etc., small entrepreneur find it difficult to sell their products.</p>"

		"title" : "Behavioral interviewing",
		"description" : "<p>“When you go in for a job interview, I think a good thing to ask is if they ever press charges.” &nbsp; -Jack Handy</p><p>When you are preparing for a job, it's important to be prepared to handle known as the interview or \"behavioral interviewing\". This type of interviewing is done to see if an applied candidate is able to do handle the situations confronting to him/her. The specific situations are provided to see the responses. The interview wants examples of what will happen in particular challenging circumstance, what you did and how did you achieve a positive outcome.</p><p>The best you can do to prepare for behavioral interviews is to discover about the company as much as you can, discover about the position of the job you are applying for, read through about your job of what different situations can occur so you have an idea of what the employer wants and you can be as smart as you can. Answering specific and direct points to interviewer will obviously increase your chances of hiring.</p><p><img src=\"http://www.prospectpersonnel.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Interview-Preparation-e1462279432812.jpg\" alt=\"Image result for interview techniques for employers\" class=\"fr-draggable\"><br></p><p><strong>Prepare for best</strong></p><p>Before going to the interview, prepare as much as you can. There might be a situation that interviewer didn't ask you a question so don't prepare only for behavioral questions. You should always be ready for every type of question because it's better to be ready in case.</p><p><strong>Techniques</strong></p><p>Start from collecting your ideas, think of possible situations. Take time and frame your responses. Look in the mirror and try answering in order to boost up your confidence. Also, prepare for how to handle the situation or in case you are asked any uncertain question which is for you become very difficult to answer. Don't worry in case you don't need the answer in you don't understand the question, ask for clarification. This will buy you some extra time to think about how to answer and what to answer. Your answer should be presentable and try to answer in most intelligent and clever way. Be sure to include some points in your answer:</p><p>(a) A situation of some specific genre</p><p>(b) The action you will take</p><p>(c) The think or task to be done</p><p>(d) The outcome i.e. what happened</p><p>Do keep in mind that there are no wrong or right answers to questions and especially in the case of a behavioral interview. The least you should do is to be confident about the answer you are giving. This will create a good impression on your interviewer. How you will respond will determine that t\\if there is a match between your skills and the position the company is seeking to fill.</p><p>Listen carefully your question. don't interrupt while somebody is asking something even if you already have understood the question. It's very important in interviews to act smart but not over smart. There is a chance they may throw you out directly. If your answers are not what the interviewer wants then this position is not the be the best job you are looking for anyway.</p><p><strong>Notes for interview</strong></p><p>Was there something you wished you have said during the interview or something you wished you had never said which changed all the game? Your subsequent notes will give you a chance to improve this. It's also an opportunity to reiterate your interest in the job and the company.</p><p>Preparation, punctuality, active listening, respond quickly, taking an active decision, displaying an assured self-confidence, optimism, being able to talk beyond your initial, expressing your attitude for the hiring committee's at the end of the interview is what these days interview demands and play a vital role in your hiring.</p><p>Remember, if you are nervous before the interview or your first interview then there is nothing bad about it. Even professional feels stomach in their butterflies before the interview. Try to calm yourself by drinking water, steady your nerves, try to talk to people, dress in a very elegant way as dressing plays a very important role in building your confidence, arrive early so you can take some time to adjust to the situation and can calm your breathing.</p><p><br></p>"

It has been stated that an ancient Indian ruler Muhammad Bin Tuqlaq once had this practice of demolishing <em>all the gold coins and changing it to copper coins</em>. The demonetisation policies of India came into existence on 8<sup>th</sup> November 2016. When the PM declared that the 500 and 1000 rupees notes were declared invalid. According to him “the banning of notes of higher values may make it difficult for the wrongdoers to store money in such a large notes.<a href=\"#_edn1\" name=\"_ednref1\" title=\"\">This as he said would bring into limelight about the black money holders.</a></p><p><a href=\"#_edn1\" name=\"_ednref1\" title=\"\">&nbsp;</a></p><p><a href=\"#_edn1\" name=\"_ednref1\" title=\"\">Generally from the survey conducted among bankers, businessmen and employed it is noted that all the three of them have more negative impacts than positive impacts. One thing very good about demonetization is that it had brought a fear and check on the corrupt people. But for bankers they feel that their work has been so tiring and hectic as they get pressure both from public as well as officials. Businessmen think that there should be have been a proper execution of the policy as they depend on public and banks for their business. On the other side, general public evidently suffer a lot of damage as they could not carry out their day to day transactions, standing in queues for money, blocking of card transaction, restriction on withdrawal of cash and so on. It can be concluded that sudden banning of a currency which is being in circulation of 86% of total circulation will have a negative impact on money supply which will in turn have its effect on liquidity and investment as both are depending upon flow of money.</a></p><a href=\"#_edn1\" name=\"_ednref1\" title=\"\"></a><a href=\"#_edn1\" name=\"_ednref1\" title=\"\"></a><a href=\"#_ednref1\" name=\"_edn1\" title=\"\"></a><a href=\"#_ednref1\" name=\"_edn1\" title=\"\">&nbsp;&nbsp;</a><a href=\"#_ednref1\" name=\"_edn1\" title=\"\">&nbsp;</a><a href=\"#_ednref1\" name=\"_edn1\" title=\"\">&nbsp;</a><p></p>"

Rather, various individuals want to utilize a less confused strategy called an IOU. <strong><em><u>An IOU, which can be in composed or verbal shape, is a casual affirmation of a little obligation, as a rule between companions, colleagues or relatives</u></em></strong>. <strong><em>A worker who acquires some change from an insignificant money finance, for instance, may comprise an IOU to represent the cash.</em></strong></p><p align=\"center\"><strong><em>&nbsp;<img src=\"https://news.o2.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/IOU-920x400.jpg\" alt=\"Image result for IOU\" class=\"fr-draggable\"></em></strong></p><p align=\"center\"><strong><em>The name originates from the exacting phonetic spelling of \"I Owe You.\" When working out a formal note recognizing an obligation, the indebted person frequently thought that it was a lot less demanding to contract \"I owe you...\" to IOU.</em></strong> Despite the fact that the birthplace of the shortened form in English, different nations likewise perceive the significance behind the term.</p><p align=\"center\"><img src=\"https://legaltemplates.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/IOU-1-340x339.png\" alt=\"Image result for IOU\" class=\"fr-draggable\"><br></p><p align=\"center\">An IOU isn't the equivalent as a formal promissory note or another monetary contract.

However, here it has its place-a more general observation. As in various other issues caused by the development of technology, the new technological means of communication (typography, telegraph, telephone, radio, Internet), it seems that the fresh ethical challenges are not at all new. They are simply enlarged but without introducing a new category of reflection: the multitude of their repercussions, their intensity and the temporal depth of their consequences are all increased significantly. However, there are no &quot;new&quot; qualities of ethical concern.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In principle, the low cost, the fluency and the almost unlimited scope of communication between individuals and ideas have already contributed to the productive and cultural development. However, we do not yet have sufficient empirical data on the malfunctioning of the Internet in order to establish a convincing theory and to be able to move rationally towards an optimization. Nonetheless, we must to systematically record the disputes and the side effects. And for those associated with Internet use for advertising purposes, we apply what we noted for the advertisement last time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the more specific direction of the confirmatory communication between individuals (a direction whose feuilleton underline particularly importance), it is interesting to note that the Internet has actually created new conditions:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A) The number of messages you receive may give you additional choice and time available, though,with adverse effects on your mental health. And the potential consequences of &#39;solitary &#39; work, somewhere here are classified.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>B) The prevalence of English has broadened the communication between people that come from different cultural backgrounds with all the humanistic consequencesof this event.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>C) The phenomenon of &quot;friends&quot; search on the Internet has not yet been sufficiently analyzed. No one can disavow the fundamental communication pleasure that this street offers. However, it has been recognized that anonymity and heteronomy (the possibility of retiring completely and unilaterally from the relationship) may invalidate the benefit of the institution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>D)The ability to harm individuals or groups via the Internet (from promotion to abuse, to theft of funds), sometimes sounds nightmarish. And it shows how muchcommunication can be put in a society. The scale differs only and unfortunately differs exponentially.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, we should take into account that there are millions of disabled people around the world (blind, deaf, paralyzed, etc.) who, thanks to additional Braille software, vocal composition etc are now able to communicate on the Internet, study and communicate with anyone staying pinned in the wheelchair or in the prison room.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To sum up, Internet is a modern way of communication that facilitates our lives in various ways and achieves to increase its quality. As this constitutes an important asset, we should not forget that Internet is a blessing to some extent!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

This blog is being prepared by Support Router&rsquo;s <strong>TP-link router support</strong> technicians. <strong>TP-Link router Australia</strong> is a third-party company that provides support for TP-link routers. Now follow the instructions below to limit the Wi-Fi speed of your TP-link router.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Double click on your browser and go to its&rsquo; address bar and type <strong>192.168.0.1.&nbsp;</strong>You will get a popup that will ask for login credentials. Now after using correct credentials click on the option called <strong>IP QoS</strong>. Noe from the left-hand navigation menu goes to Advance Setting.</li>\r\n\t<li>In the <strong>Advance Setting</strong>, you will find options like bandwidth type, bandwidth applies, ID, ID range, mode, bandwidth, description. These options are important because whatever value you will enter during the time of configuration will be responsible to control your bandwidth&rsquo;s speed. &nbsp;Now check the option <strong>Enable IP QoS&nbsp;</strong>to enable it.</li>\r\n\t<li>Next, you are supposed to choose a bandwidth type from the&nbsp;drop-down menu. You may also select &lsquo;<strong>Other</strong>&rsquo; and enter internet speed.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Define the IP range:&nbsp;</strong>This is the IP range that will be affected by bandwidth limit settings.</li>\r\n\t<li>There are total two separate modes. You need to select one from them<strong>. Maximum bandwidth guarantee</strong>, <strong>maximum bandwidth Limit</strong> are two modes. In maximum bandwidth guarantee mode, one can work to control bandwidth but it never limits speed. So, there will be no guarantee that you can get maximum bandwidth. On the other hand, with a maximum bandwidth limit, each client can decide how much maximum speed they wish to acquire.</li>\r\n\t<li>&nbsp;<strong>Rule Description:</strong> Here you need to type the full description of the rule that you have already set.</li>\r\n\t<li>Now enable each rule by clicking on by checking all the &lsquo;<strong>Enable</strong>&rsquo; buttons. And finally, click on &lsquo;<strong>Save</strong>&rsquo; button.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>And thus, your job is done. This is how you can limit Wi-Fi speed.

Often, however, developers want to write a small application that covers a particular need quickly.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Python is a simple yet powerful programming language that allows us to develop gadgets quickly and easily.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Python is a dynamic programming language of very high standard. Its main objective is its increased developer productivity and readability of the code. It has built-in data structures, such as lists and dictionaries and a fairly large library, guiding the batteries includedphilosophy.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Python has some common elements with oblique, object-oriented, but also it has functional programming without imposing any specific programming, unlike Java.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Its features make it a good choice for prototyping, but also for a multitude of applications where performance is not so important.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Python is a learning and yet powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective anti-routine programming.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Python's stylish syntax and dynamic formulas, along with its function as a predictable (instead of compiled language), make it an ideal language for creating scripts and for rapidly deploying applications across multiple platforms.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Python is a very beautiful, highly fuzzy,object-oriented, high-level prediction engine. Its type system is fully dynamic and memory management automatic, its standard implementation (CPython) is a bytecode compiler and interpreter and its library is rich.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Note that the basic principle of Python programming is that the developer's time is much more important than the machine cycle and relieves him/her from the low-level details that he has totake care of in C / C ++ or, to a certain extent, in Java.</span></p>"

As Simon Cozens pinpointed it is the <span lang=\"EN-US\">“</span>traditional spell to programming gods to help us learnthe programming language better”.</p><p>So, to display the\"Welcome to Python world!\" message in our first script, we should open the Python GUI. Then, we should choose File → New Window or press Ctrl + N and enter the print (\"Welcome to Python world\") program. &nbsp;Next, to that we select File → Save or Ctrl +S and save it as welcometopython.py. Then, while staying in the code window, we should select Run module and press F5.</p><p>We can also run this program by opening a shell (Linux terminal or command line in DOS) and importing the Python 3.3.2 <a href=\"welcometopython.py%20command.command.\" target=\"_blank\">welcometopython.py command.</a> Bear in mind that before you give the command to run helloworld.py, you must have moved to the folder where the <a href=\"welocometopython.py%20file%20is%20storedfile%20is%20stored\" target=\"_blank\">welocometopython.py file is&nbsp;</a>stored.&nbsp;After that, some remarkable remarks are worthwhile to be mentioned. Python gives you the output of the line directly. What you write is a statement in the Python language. Use the “print” order to get whatever value we provide</p><p>Closing the console: To close the console, press ctrl-d (EOF-End Of File symbol) if you use IDLE or a Linux / BSD shell. Respectively, if you use the Windows command prompt, press ctrl-z and then press<a href=\"Closing%20the%20console%3A%20To%20close%20the%20console,%20press%20ctrl-d%20(EOF-End%20Of%20File%20symbol)%20if%20you%20use%20IDLE%20or%20a%20Linux%20/%20BSD%20shell.%20Respectively,%20if%20you%20use%20the%20Windows%20command%20prompt,%20press%20ctrl-z%20and%20then%20press%20enter.If%20you%20have%20receivedan%20error%20message,%20re-write%20the%20above%20program%20and%20run%20it%20again\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;</a>enter. If you have received an error message, re-write the above program and run it again.</p><p>Note that Python is case-sensitive, for example print is not the same as Print. Also, make sure there are no spaces or tabs before the first character (letter) on each line.</p><p>Let's stand on the first two lines of the program. These are called comments. So whatever the right # symbol is a comment. Comments are mainly used as notes for the program reader.</p><p>Python ignores the comments except for the first line special case. Thisis called the shebang line. Anytime the first two characters of the source file are # followed by the location of a program. This tells the Linux / Unix system that this program should be run with this interpreter when it's time to run.</p><p>For example, write:</p><p>#!/usr/bin/python3.3</p><p>#Filename:welcometopython.py</p><p>print (\"Welcome to Python world!\")</p><p>Note that you can always run the program on any platform by specifying the interpreter directly at the command line. For example, if you use Python 3.3.2, press welcometopython.py.</p><p>Use comments in your programs to explain some important details of the program. It is very useful for readers of your program so they can easily understand what the program does.</p><p>Comments are followed by the Python command. Here, we use the print function that simply prints the text “Welcome to Python world!”. In any case, remember that whatever you enter between parentheses will be printed on the screen</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>"

A good processor will help you write Python programs, mowing your jacket more comfortable and helping you stay in your destination in a much easier and safer way.</p><p>One of the basic requirements is the syntax coloring label where all the different parts of the Python pictogram are properly colored so that you can see the program and have a snapshot of its execution. Also highlighting helps us to detect any syntax errors we have made in the code because it will not be scratched as would be expected a word or a command.</p><p>For Windows users, IDLE is suggested. This IDLE makes code syntax and much more like what allows you to run your programs through IDLE among other things. Important Note: It is a bad choice because it is not editorial and it does not support the alignment of the text, which is not a very important feature in ourcase.

Note that the processors are coloring the code in order to make it easier to read but do not provide execution work. You must run the programs outside the word processor.</p><p>Experienced developers use Vim and Emacs. These are two of the most powerful code processors and you will benefit from using them to write your Python's projects. In the event that you are willing to devise a fritter to learn Vim or Emacs then it is highly recommended to learn to use any of the 2 as they will make you a very useful course</p><p>Int his paper I will use the IDE, the IDE (Integrated Development Environment) and the code editor I have chosen.

It allows you to concentrate on a solution to a&nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">problem rather than the language itself.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Easy to learn: It is&nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">extremely easy to start with Python. Python has an unusually simple syntax.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Free and TracingCode: Python is an example of free software and open source software. Simply&nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">put, you can distribute copies of the software, read its source code, make&nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">changes to it, and use its tracks in new free programs. Free software and open&nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">source software is based on the idea of a community that is related toknowledge. This is one of the reasons why the python is so good.

When you run it program, the l</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">ink copies the program to memory and starts running it. Python, from the&nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">other, does not need to be compiled into a binary file. Just run the program&nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">directly from the source code. Internally, the Python converts the source code&nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">into an intermediate form called bytecode, and then translates it into the</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">PC language and after that it&nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">runs the program. All this actually makes the use of the Python much easier&nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">because you do not have to worry about spreading the program, linking it with&nbsp;</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">the appropriate libraries. This also makes the programs of the library e</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">xtremely portable, since you can just copy the Python that you made on another computer and work that way.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Expandable: If youneed a critical piece of code to run too fast or if you need to have a bit of an algorithm that is not open, then you can program that piece in C or C ++ and then use it from your Python program.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Object-oriented: Python supports both procedure-oriented and object-oriented programming. In the process-oriented, the program builds on processes or functions that are not hing but re-used tracks in these programs. In object-oriented programming, programs are built on objects that combine data and functionality. Python has a very powerful but very simple way for object-oriented programming especially when compared to other languages, like&nbsp;</span>C++ <span lang=\"EN-US\">or</span><span lang=\"EN-US\">&nbsp;</span>Java.</p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Embeddable: You can integrate the Python into the programs in C / C ++ to give them \"scripting\" capabilities for your users.</span></p><p><span lang=\"EN-US\">Extensive libraries: The template library is really huge. It can help you do various things in terms of regular expressions, document creation, unit views, filming, databases, web browsing, CGI, FTP, email, XML, RPC, HTML, WAV files, (GUI) graphical user interfaces, Tk, and other things that depend on the system. Remember that all of these are available whenever the Python is installed. This is called the \"Batteries Included\" philosophy of Python.

This programming language has an elegant though not very simplified syntax and a small number of powerful and high-level data types.</p><p>Python can be extended by adding new mods that are written in a compiled language, such as C or C ++. These extension modules can define new features and variables, as well as new objective types. Python is often compared to other interpretive programming syllables, such as Java, JavaScript, Perl, Tcl and Smalltalk, but comparisons can also be made with C ++, Common Lisp or Scheme.</p><p>Its main goal is the readability of its code and user-friendly. It is distinguished by the fact that it has a lot of libraries that make it very easy for a lot of ordinary work and for the speed of learning it.</p><p>Python is developed as an open source and managed by the non-profit Python Software Foundation.

These technologies will be increasing in use in 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img class=\"fr-dib fr-draggable\" src=\"https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/atg-storage-s3/assets/Frontend/images/article_image/feature_inside-034000000020191613657315.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Search by voice</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Voice search is usefulness is gaining popularity. It is now seems as a necessary factor in search engine dominance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is now recorded that 20% of all search engine activities are based on voice search. This trend is also applicable to e-Commerce. Forbes reports that the current voice purchase market of $ 2 billion will grow to $ 40 billion by 2020.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This massive increase in market share will only continue as buyers accept Alexa-type voice assistants for their daily shopping activities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Convenient shipping and collection of products</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>With 40% of the total participation in the e-Commerce market, Amazon leads the way, especially in regard to logistics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The normal behavior of deliveries on the same day or the next day will be affected and change as companies compete to immerse as Amazon&rsquo;s customers first choice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There will be other changes that can benefit buyers like month monthly shipping subscriptions, unpaid programs, and &quot;buy online / pick up offline&quot;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Augmented Reality</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As e-Commerce companies try to improve their sales techniques, augmented reality could become a successful tool.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of today&#39;s buyers use online stores to collect information about products, but a large percentage is still in favor of making final purchases in physical stores.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what guides this behavior? Online purchases involve uncertainty which is the factor to this behavior according to research.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When a person shop or buy in the internet, he or she cannot really see the actual item and they cannot touch it either. You have to use your imagination and fill in those blanks. For some buyers, that&#39;s good enough.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For others, not so much. With augmented reality added to an existing e-commerce site, companies can help their customers obtain a &quot;real-life&quot; product experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Giants like IKEA and Amazon already use these technologies, but we can expect this trend to extend to the medium and even to some small companies throughout 2019 and 2020.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Chatbots customer service</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although still underdeveloped in some parts of the world, customer service chatbots are reaching the spotlight with commercial and e-Commerce websites and we can expect to see more of this in 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, chatbots will be the first direct experience of many consumers with automation based on artificial intelligence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The similarities to human service make this chatbots capable to be on the same level of customer services guidance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where they fall short is in non-typical situations, and this can be potentially harmful to businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"embed-container-youtube responsive-video-embed\"><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"360\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/playlist?wmode=opaque\" width=\"640\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Jet Set Fly movement is really about you, we are inviting you to grow with us.

In this attempt, the contribution of Big Data and Data Analytics can be an invaluable strategic resource for the organization. Exploiting data analytics tools, managers can make more accurate decisions as these decisions would be based on facts, quantitative research and not on suppositions. So, analytics is highly related to the decision-making process and constitutes not only a competitive advantage for the company but a strategic resource as well. Particularly, he expressed the notion that such competitive advantages can stem from the good use of business intelligence and predictive analytics. These tools are also well-implementable to every industry and every sector of the organization, such as marketing, operational department, quality management.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>However, to effectively use analytics, organizations should have Big Data and expertise people who can interpret them. Simultaneously, researchers have shown that companies used data analytics they should have the following characteristics: analytics supported a strategic, distinctive capability; the approach to and management of analytics was enterprise-wide; senior management was committed to the use of analytics, and the company made a significant strategic bet on analytics-based competition. Also, data analytics gives a competitive advantage to companies as data are cheaper to be collected comparing to previous years, there are useful tools that can interpret them without needing to invest a lot of money to infrastructures and there are people that can make this work and find the value that is hidden behind those data.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>For example, Internet of Things (IoT) assists companies to see their customers’ attitudes regarding certain products at a real-time base; hence giving companies the advantage to correspond quickly to customers’ behaviors. Apart from that, analytics can be used as an asset for companies since it provides a great chance for them to make extensive research concerning the market trends and the organizations’ operating activities, something that facilitates organization to see the sales trends, the improvements or the amendments needed to be done inside the organization, as well as the opportunities that emerge to the market. Also, organizations which exploit data analytics are able to innovate in the Market by making significant modifications in their processes or their products/services or by creating entirely new business models. This means that analytical practitioners are basically concentrated on operational improvements and strive to bring about data-driven innovations. Particularly, the most successful companies that used analytics exploit the artificial intelligence technology soas to increase the employees’ skills, save time from “big” projects and help managers to concentrate on the strategic details of the projects rather than involving managers to administrating processes demanded on such projects. Also, through this procedure, companies have the ability to detect and exploit new opportunities concerning their partnerships that can boost their business value chain. Along with this, companies that use data analytics, they increase their access to only useful data; hence saving time and money.</p><p><br></p><p>From the analysis above, it became more than apparent that data analytics contribute companies in miscellaneous ways, from resolving strategic issues to providing technological improvements such as cloud computing which ultimately concluded to acquire companies a sustainable competitive advantage.&nbsp;</p>"

Potential says anything may be possible. Potential must be exercised in order to be fulfilled. A demand must be placed on it because your potential is unlimited but you need to give your ability a responsibility].</p><p dir=\"ltr\">&nbsp;B = Belief; Firm self-belief will tap your inner hidden energies and passion will give you kicks constantly unmindful of the results.&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">[Self awareness and analysis of our behaviour or personality is obtained by introspection, SWOT and JOHARI window processes]. Introspection is a method to look into one’s own self. SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis is to&nbsp;reveal positive forces that work together and potential problems that need to be recognized and possibly addressed.&nbsp;JOHARI window helps us to gain greater awareness of self and enhancing the open area which assists us in improving our human relations.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">C = Creative;&nbsp;Come out of conditioned thinking and opening up minds will help in unleashing the hidden potential.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">[Everyone has a role to cut out and you were born to achieve something big in this world. No two people are alike. Even twins are not alike. Therefore, you are unique with special talents and skills. You should learn to explore your hidden talents and exploit the skills to achieve success in your life].</p><p dir=\"ltr\">D = Design your destiny&nbsp;by optimizing your potentials to reach goals.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">[The process of setting goals by following SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable/Attainable, Realistic, Time-bound) criteria, provides a basis for motivation. Goal setting is effective only if the individual is aware of what is to be achieved and accepts it for himself].</p><p dir=\"ltr\">E = Excellence;&nbsp;Human potential is ultimately about the pursuit of individual excellence for the benefit of all.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">[Maslow's theory nicely explains about Deficit needs (Physiological, Safety, Belonging, Esteem) and Being needs (Self-actualization) in the pyramid diagram of Hierarchy of needs. Self actualization (the fulfilment of self through reaching one’s potential) is the highest expression of human life. It is a journey of self discovery, self improvement and self realization].&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">F = Fear of failure;&nbsp;Don’t cover-up the natural qualities and incredible nature that you were endowed with. It’s time to embrace the person you can become, and find the potential hidden behind your insecurities and pain.</p><p dir=\"ltr\">[Consider why you failed and explore what you can do next time. Use failure as a teacher to learn where you still need to do some work].&nbsp;</p><p dir=\"ltr\">Life is all about overcoming adversity. In order to see our potential, we must heal from our past pain. Personal struggles can be a powerful source for uncovering our potential and purpose. We all have this potential for great things if we’re willing to lay the foundation and sow the seeds</p>"

		"description" : "<p>In case you&#39;re attempting to introduce Microsoft Office in your framework, there may be numerous blunders that may happen during the establishment procedure. Generally mistakes happen while you attempt to add email record to Microsoft office.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>In this way, here, I thought of a contextual investigation for mistake 1377 that happened during the establishment, at that point account expansion and evacuation process.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How about we begin!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>For what reason Does the Error 1377 Occur and How to Fix This?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While I effectively introduced the Microsoft Office, I needed to do the essential testing whether it is working fine or not. Along these lines, I made a demo account.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the testing was done, I attempted to expel this record from the Microsoft Office Local Users and Groups. Be that as it may, sadly, the mistake 1377 happened.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This mistake demonstrates that the part couldn&#39;t be found in the nearby gathering.

		"description" : "<p>WeChat is one of the most popular social media platforms, and it is gaining new users day by day. It has over 100 million users on Android, and it has over 1 billion users globally.&nbsp;Wechat is extremely fun and offers many amazing features. One of such features is its Group chat feature which allows you to create a group and invite people to it. In this article, you will learn how to invite someone to your group in WeChat. But, first let&rsquo;s see how to make a group in your WeChat. So what are you waiting for? Let&rsquo;s dive in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How to Create a Group in WeChat?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to create a new group, then these steps will help you to do just that. You can easily start a group and add some of your contact to it.&nbsp;Once the group is made, you will be able to start a conversation with your chosen contacts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. &nbsp; &nbsp; Open your WeChat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. &nbsp; &nbsp; Now on your top-right corner, you will see a &lsquo;+&rsquo; button there. Press it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. &nbsp; &nbsp; After that, tap on the &ldquo;Group Chat&rdquo; option.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. &nbsp; &nbsp; Thereafter, choose the people that you want to add in this group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5. &nbsp; &nbsp; Finally hit the OK button.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How to Add People to Your Group Chat on WeChat?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now the group is created, and you already have added some contacts to your group. But what if you want to add more people to it? This section will tell you how to do just that. One method to add people in the existing WeChat group is to send the QR code to them through a different messenger such as WhatsApp or Gmail. With the help of that QR code, one can be added to the group anytime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another way to add people to the group is to do it manually by yourself. Let&rsquo;s see how the process goes:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Navigate to the group chat in which you want to add the person.</li>\r\n\t<li>Once you reached there, hit the &ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo;(three dots) Button.</li>\r\n\t<li>Now go to the &lsquo;+&rsquo; icon.</li>\r\n\t<li>Choose the contacts which you want to add in your WeChat group.</li>\r\n\t<li>After that Hit the Ok button.</li>\r\n\t<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Now the people you want in your group are successfully added, and you can add more people whenever you want.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How to Remove Someone from the Group Chats?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Only a group admin or leader can remove people from a group. If you are the admin, then you have the authority to remove contacts from it. Here&rsquo;s how to remove a contact from a group in WeChat:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>Navigate to the Group Chat on your device.</li>\r\n\t<li>locate and press the &ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo; button.</li>\r\n\t<li>Now look for the contact which you want to take out from your group.</li>\r\n\t<li>After that long-press the person&rsquo;s profile image until you see a red circle.</li>\r\n\t<li>Click the red circle in order to remove the person from the group chat.</li>\r\n\t<li>&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>If that person still has a QR code invitation from you, then they can rejoin your group without your permission. If you want someone to rejoin the group, then go ahead and add them manually as we did before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Source url:-<a href=\"Source url:-&nbsp;http://quickproductactivate.com/blog/how-to-create-and-invite-people-to-group-chat-on-wechat/\" target=\"_blank\">Source url:-&nbsp;http://quickproductactivate.com/blog/how-to-create-and-invite-people-to-group-chat-on-wechat/</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"Ava Williams&nbsp;is an avid technical blogger, a magazine contributor, a publisher of guides at&nbsp;mcafee.com/activate, and a professional cyber security analyst.

Here we will address some of the concerns of prospective customers for <a href=\"https://www.errandsserviceprovider.sg/\"><strong>part time cleaner Singapore</strong></a>. A common belief among office cleaning providers is that customers are always in the look-out of low cost services which is wrong. Even if you are priced above your competitors your services must be extensive enough to outweigh the package price. It is ultimately the quality and its cost-effectiveness that concerns your customers. An extremely low priced package might get people into thinking that your services are incompetent and of low quality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet another factor is the extensiveness of your business. For any sector, clients always prefer companies who can provide them all they want. For example, someone looking for <strong>part time cleaner Singapore</strong> might not just want to settle down with office cleaning alone. They might also want their windows and retails cleaned. Because you help your clients save time and money, you win the chance of winning a cleaning contract. There is often a belief among the clients that part time cleaner Singapore service is always highly priced for the range of professional equipments and cleaning materials used. You can break into the mindset comprising this belief and explain how you could provide your professional services using high end latest equipments and best cleaning products at competitive prices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is also important to be ready to negotiate with your customers. For example, a house owner might want your visit on an unscheduled day for a picnic holiday or because of a home party. Be ready for it. Make your customers feel that you are in business dedicated to fulfill their requirements. In the end being consistent and meticulous in the long run is the key to success. Earn your competitive edge by knowing what the exact requirements of your customers are and operating accordingly. They are people who will never frustrate you or fail to rise to the occasion. You will find that these companies have a customer care desk that operates on a round-the-clock basis to ensure no customer is inconvenienced in any way. With that, you have no reason not to engage <strong>part time cleaner Singapore</strong> for this purpose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n"

		"title" : "Water Damage Where You Least Want It",
		"description" : "<p>You did it, you created an oasis for just you: your hobbies, your interests, your friends, your passions. Whether you use it every weekend, or only for the Super Bowl, outbuildings need to be protected from <a href=\"https://challisrestorationservices.com/water-damage-cleanup-cedar-rapids-3/\"><strong>water damage in Cader Rapids</strong></a>. Floodwater or a broken pipe can cause extensive and irreversible damage. Floods or disasters can ruin your space by 1) wiping out belongings and 2) permanently damaging floors and walls to your Davenport establishment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is important to take the time to flood-proof your outbuildings. Floodwater can cause permanent damage to furniture, books, documents, and other water-sensitive items, and it can cause the wood to swell and warp. If water is not immediately removed, we at Challis Restoration know that mold and other microbial organisms can begin to grow.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Prepare Before A Flood Or Heavy Rains</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You should also work to flood-proof your home and external spaces before the rainy season. For example, if the space is below ground level, install a sump pump and backup power source. Add backflow valves to toilets and drains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once a flood warning has been announced, immediately gather the emergency supply kit and pay attention to the TV or radio for updates. If possible, make sure to bring in any outdoor items such as grills, furniture, and trash cans. Securely tie down large items. Carry every valuable thing in the space to the highest floor in the house, especially that big screen T.V.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>After Water Damage</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the flood, call your insurance provider as soon as possible. Take pictures of the damage and make sure to keep accurate records throughout the repair process. After the appropriate steps have been taken, the cleanup process should begin. For safety reasons, the electricity to the entire house should be turned off. Floodwater needs to be removed immediately to prevent the growth of mold and other dangerous organisms, so it is a good idea to call in a professional to handle the extensive cleanup process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Is It Covered By Insurance?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You&rsquo;ll want to notify your agent about your new structure, of course, but most homeowners policies will cover buildings on your property that aren&rsquo;t attached to your home, like a gazebo, shed or detached garage through &ldquo;other structures protection.&rdquo; Typically, the standard coverage is for 10 percent of the amount of insurance you have on your home. So if your home is insured for $300,000, your shed and other structures would be insured for 10 percent of that, $30,000.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Total coverage is for all of your unattached buildings, including fixtures like fences. So if the addition of the shed now brings the value of your outbuildings to more than 10 percent of your standard coverage, you may want to increase the total of your homeowners insurance policy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Plus you may want to be careful about what exactly you store in your shed and consider what perils your policy covers. To properly protect certain high-value items like a billiard table, you can purchase additional coverage that protects the specific item for its appraised value. Enjoy your new building, but don&rsquo;t keep valuables in your shed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve experienced a major spill in your hideaway, call us as soon as possible. The concrete floor can sustain water damage, staining, and other problems if the water remains for too long, and the walls can lose some structural integrity as well. The longer you wait, the worse the damage will get.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Call Challis For Your Water Damage Needs</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The team at Challis Restoration in Davenport knows the restoration and recovery process &ndash; from first-aid measures and emergency response to technical services and total reconstruction.
